As a kind of public service of some sort, I’ve been recording the Open Mic night at the [Stonewall Tavern][1] in [Eagleville, CT][2], which has been hosted by the terrific [Blaney Brothers][3] for the past few years. I have been putting the recordings up for anyone who wants them, arranged by date and artist on MediaFire, at . Enjoy… (But don’t complain too much about it. It’s all straight board-out to mp3 using this little gem: arecord -f cd -t raw -D hw:1,0 | lame --verbose -x -s 44.1 - "${OUTPUTFILE}")

(Also, I’ve been fortunate enough to do an actual studio session with the Blaneys. I’ll probably release it at some point, with their permission, of course.)
