The Stonewall Tavern in Eagleville, CT hosts an open mic night every Tuesday night. It was formerly hosted by the Blaney Brothers, and is now hosted by Rob and Johnny.

I usually record the sets and put them online, as well as occasionally take pictures.

For those interested in the particulars, I record everything using a [Thinkpad T61][2] running [Ubuntu Linux][3] connected to a [Behringer UCA-202][4] device connected via the USB port. All cutting was done with [mp3cut][5] (using normalization), after finding positions using [Audacity][6]. I have been using the service provided by the nice people at [MediaFire][7] to provide free file hosting services.

If you really don’t have access to a CD burner, I can make copies on request. I don’t charge for them, but bear in mind that you have to keep it within reason, and you may have to replenish my blanks supply if you use them all up.
