Sometime this coming week I’ll have [Jason Bachand][1] in the studio, to work on his track for the upcoming progressive rock benefit compilation [The Tsunami Project][2], which includes tracks from Nick D’Virgilio, Neal Morse, Randy George, IQ, Mark McCrite, IZZ and Jimmy Keegan. Hopefully we won’t let them down … ;)
