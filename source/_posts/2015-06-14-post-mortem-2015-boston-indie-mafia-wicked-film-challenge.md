The Boston-area independent film organization "[Boston Indie Mafia](http://www.bostonindiemafia.org/)" recently held their first annual [Wicked Film Challenge](http://www.bostonindiemafia.org/whats-wfc/). In stark contrast to strictly timed competitions like the [48 Hour Film Project](http://48hourfilm.com/), it takes place over several months. My team, [Shoot the Moon Films](http://shootthemoonfilms.com), entered along with several other teams. This is my record of both the timetable/process we used and a post-mortem analysis of the flaws and potential improvements in our processes in creating "[The Gift of Fate](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4694700/)".

## Writing and Pre-Production

We had our regular team of crack writers, [Natasha Darius](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5720821/) and [Nicholas Magrey](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3895408/), agree to write the script based on the criteria we had been handed. They came up with a workable concept almost immediately, and cranked out a script within a few days.

We looked around for a lecture hall, which was to house the bulk of the filming -- but the costs involved with renting out any of the local lecture halls proved to be cost-prohibitive. It ended up being easier (and far less expensive) to use a local theater/auditorium. The other two locations were confirmed by members of the production staff at no charge to us.

## Preparing Assets

With months of additional time compared to a 48 hour film project, we were able to arrange more collateral/assets for the project.

Our required prop was a bloody signet ring, so we found an authentic period (early 20th century or earlier) French signet ring, stamped with the fleur-de-lis, and purchased it from eBay. The seller was located just over the border of Rhode Island, so they were able ship it to us in less than the week lead time we had.

We needed a number of pieces of collateral to help sell the historical illusion which we were creating with the film. In order to do this, we had our actress ([Debra Leigh Siegel](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6562106/)) dress in period clothes borrowed from the local theater, and had her made up with period makeup and hair. We set up an evening to create the proper black and white photos to attempt to match the historical photos we found on Google Images. I ended up using a 135mm soft-focus lens (which I had procured from a grey-market retailer a few years ago) to get the desired image in-camera, with no digital manipulation required apart from desaturating the image.

Once we had our images captured, we had the Staples Print Shop produce a 24x36" poster and a book cover which our production designer mocked up from the images we had taken.

## Building and Preparing the Set

The major set building required for the shoot involved putting together an analog for an early 20th century French prison. In order to cut down the build difficultly, we chose to keep the shots fairly claustrophobic, and allowed the majority of the representation of the prison to be done using light and shadow.

We emptied two walls in a basement which had suitable walls, and covered all present light sources. We set up a window-with-bars assembly, and masked it off so that a single point light source would properly cast well-defined shadows on the principal actress (who was also, coincidentally, the lighting designer / gaffer for the project). Our set carpenter then used scrap wood to build a working door assembly, and masked off the areas around it with a combination of wood, trash bags, and tarp -- held together mostly by [The Handyman's Secret Weapon](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BSDZJSKiVI).

It took us about four or five hours to do the majority of the preparatory set build, and another few hours on the day of the shoot to finish it up. Special thanks to [Paul "Tues-Dee" Magrey](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6562110/), our expert carpenter and all-around boom guy, and the [Bradley Playhouse](http://thebradleyplayhouse.org/), for lending us some set dressing and wooden assemblies. 

*The downside to shooting in a basement was that the crew had to wear particle masks to avoid any potential respiratory issues, and the cast members were only present during the actual takes.*

## Shoot Day 1: At the Theater and Beyond

We met a little after 8:00 A.M. at the "Little Theater" building, and loaded our equipment in to start shooting for 10:00 A.M. Due to the number of extras, we isolated them to a second area until our primary cast had been set up and blocked out. As we were unable to modify the props on the side of the stage, which had been staged out for a childrens' performance of "Shrek: The Musical", we augmented with construction paraphernalia to obscure the patently obvious set pieces. We were also able to use a piece of set to form an alcove, which made shooting a particular shot easier to capture.

The initial shot in the theater involved an almost-two-minute-long unbroken tracking shot using a gimbal. As it was impossible to use a boom mic in an effective way, our sound engineer rigged our H4n up as a mic pack with a lav mic we had in our kit, allowing us to capture pristine audio without trying to hide our boom operator.

We loaded our extras into the theater and shot until lunch break. The most difficult shots tended to be the Ronin shots, but we had kept them to an iterated minimum.

## Shoot Day 2: Period Set

## Post-Production

A few days after our shoot days, we put aside a few hours to cut together a rough cut. Most of the scenes required very little futzing around with in editing, as the blocking and shot notes made it a simple matter of cutting for continuity.

We ended up having to meet for ADR in Massachusetts to take care of the unusable sound from the single outdoor scene. It only took a few hours (including prep time) for Nicholas and David, our actors, to complete ADR. As the WFC provided several months to work, we were able to schedule this at an optimum time for everyone.

## Post-Mortem Analysis

Notes for improvement:

 * **Know your judges**. As the winners of the competition seemed to center around cute children winning "Best Actress" and hipster reference-laded sketches-spliced-together winning "Best Script" and "Best Film", this particular entry didn't stand a chance of winning anything. Look at the previous year's winners and gauge the idiom they're expecting, when possible, if you're attempting to produce a film with the sole purpose of winning.
 * **Outdoor sound**. We ended up having to ADR audio for an entire scene because we didn't prepare for the possibility of serious wind. We built a blimp/zeppelin for our boom mic operator for our next project, which worked out very well -- but this could have been done in time for *The Gift of Fate*.
 * **More mic packs**. The mic pack we used on David Hopcroft worked very well -- but there were a number of other long shots which could have benefited from having additional packs set up on the actors.
 * **More testing**. This was the Ronin's maiden voyage with us, and there were a few kinks to work out of the system before we started using it.
 * **The right equipment for the right shot**. One of the Ronin shots we did probably should have been set up as a dolly shot, but in the interests of setup time, I decided against it. This would have worked *far* better as a dolly shot -- so planning something that's *almost* right may not necessarily work out.
