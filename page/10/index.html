  <div class="entry-content"><p>This saturday night I had the pleasure of going to see <a href="http://www.gordonbok.com/">Gordon Bok</a>, one of the finest living folk singer/songwriters, at the Connecticut Audubon Society location in Glastonbury. I’ve been a fan of his since his <a href="http://www.gordonbok.com/bokmuirtrickett.html">Bok/Muir/Trickett</a> days, and haven’t gotten a chance to see him live since seeing him at <a href="http://folknotes.org/">The Sounding Board</a>. And yes, his voice is just as awesome as it was back then, and his storytelling skills have improved with time.</p>

<p>Besides two children who were dragged by their parents, I was the youngest person in the room by at least ten or fifteen years, which was a little disconcerting. I did, however, get to sit in the third row and get some great shots. They’ll be up on flickr when I get the chance.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I hate Windows Mobile. It’s a horrible, horrible operating system. Phones and devices based on it are just as awful.</p>

<p>My Blackberry started exhibiting very odd behavior and disconnecting from the mobile network about every 30-45 seconds, so I flashed the firmware and shouted some incantations of the dockworker variety before giving up and pronouncing it dead. My job was nice enough to furnish me with a replacement, which unfortunately runs WinMo.</p>

<p>I think I’m going to send a map and flashlight to Dan Hesse so that <a href="http://phandroid.com/2009/02/20/sprint-android-coming-ceo-reassures/">Sprint can have some help finding and removing its head from its rectum</a>. After some initial <a href="http://phandroid.com/2008/10/25/sprint-ceo-android-not-good-enough-for-us/">idiotic comments</a> from Hesse regarding how Android “[isn’t] good enough to put the Sprint brand on…” (which interestingly makes me wonder <a href="http://articles.marco.org/248">what kind of dog food they do put their brand on</a>), I’ve been cursing about the lack of <a href="http://code.google.com/android/">Android</a> on the Sprint network. I’ve used the T-Mobile G1, and that phone, despite any of the “it’s not an iPhone” mooks’ commenting, is a very nice phone with a nice open platform.</p>

<p>Can you hear me, Sprint? I don’t know why you’re dawdling, but you might as well bury WinMo. It’s a horrible, horrible platform coupled with awful phones. Also, ditch HTC if you can. I’d rather see Motorola or Nokia (or even … ugh… Samsung or LG) try their hand at an Android phone. You’re not making any friends by making us wait for a decent phone technology.</p>

<p>(As a sidebar, whoever came up with that lame rollerball on the Pearl and Curve should be taken out back and shot. It’s horrible. Well, not as horrible as the roller on the side of the 870x models, but still pretty horrible.)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The adaptation of my favorite graphic novel “Watchmen” is premiering tonight as a motion picture. I have mixed feelings about it, as the creator has disavowed all film adaptations of his work, and apparently <a href="http://entertainment.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=09/03/06/1913257">Snyder changed the ending</a>. You’d think after a travesty like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0434409/">V for Vendetta</a> that directors would keep it in their pants and learn to respect good writing. Just because you can script Keanu Reeves saying “whoa!” for a few hours doesn’t mean you can out-write Alan Moore.</p>

<p>That being said, there’s always the chance that it’s going to be amazing. From the trailers, it does look as though it has all sorts of whizz-bang Hollywoody special effects, which should at least give me 2 hours 45 minutes worth of … something.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that when Hollywood does comics, they always have to try to <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">“out do” the source material</a>. And if you don’t believe that, remember the following highlights from days of yore while you’re waiting in line for the people who just heard of this thing a few days ago to purchase their tickets:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118688/">Batman and Robin</a> – Nipples on the batsuit and the Governator playing a 90-pound weaking scientist. Bob Kane must have soiled himself just being within a few miles of any theater playing it.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0286716/">Hulk</a> – Just because you’re related to the legendary Stan Lee doesn’t mean you’re qualified to direct anything. It took a complete remake of this a few years later to take away the stink.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0311429/">League of Extraordinary Gentlemen</a> – No better way to eviscerate your source material than to completely disregard everything about it. Character development, what’s that? Let’s make Sean Connery into a badass instead of a horrible opium addict! Yeah! That’ll be better than the original! Schmucks.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0348150/">Superman Returns</a> – The original costume was going to be thrown out because someone found it, I quote, “too faggy.” And Superman was originally slated to have goons attack the bad guys in his ice palace. I couldn’t make this drek up if I tried. If that’s not enough, let <a href="http://www.supermanofsteel.com/2007/08/06/kevin-smith-on-the-topic-of-superman-returns/">Kevin Smith tear it up</a> for you.</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Another <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSN0134457520090302">30 billion ducats</a> down the toilet. I’m not sure exactly what banks are supposed to do anymore, but I could swear it <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/25/business/25nocera.html">used to have something to do with loaning money</a> to allow economic movement. Banks won’t lend money to anyone <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&amp;sid=a8ta_MEhUZ9E&amp;refer=us">without sparkling credit</a>, which means most people couldn’t get a loan.</p>

<p>Why the hell are we giving these weasels money? Their primary job is to lend money, and they can’t do that, instead favoring the primary job of funnelling money to CEOs and wealthy investors. I think AIG should probably have considered that it’s making a serious case for nationalization in that the company is proving a complete lack of responsibility in the fiscal responsibility department, while lecturing “irresponsible borrowers” about the same fiscal responsibility at the same time.</p>

<p>Well, we’re <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29671145/">going down in flames</a>. I hope you bastards had fun while it lasted.</p>

<p>(As a side note, I hate anything referring to “bailout” in a positive light. It’s not a positive thing. It’s slinging shit into an enormous chasm, and saying otherwise is wishful thinking of the highest degree. These people never cared about anything other than themselves, and nothing is going to change that. Talk about limits on investment banker salaries (for producing gornicht) and they’re up in arms, but everyone is hot on cutting autoworkers’ salaries… )</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It seems to be the fashion for people to hem and haw about how the United States is spiralling downward towards (horrors!) socialism. I’m still trying to figure out what the big deal is.</p>

<p>Capitalism is, by definition, survival of the wealthiest. In its purest, most unadulterated form, capitalism involves certain entities becoming very, very successful, while supressing others who would aspire to become as successful. It’s a very selfish philosophy in that it stresses the survival of the individual over the survival of the society, much as most Western religions stress the survival of the self (notions of individual souls) over the Eastern philosophy empasizing the sum total of everything over the notion of the individual. So, if capitalism is such a selfish thing, why do Americans as a people seem to despise socialism, when its implementation would benefit the majority of its population?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“Don’t forget that most men with nothing would rather protect the possibility of becoming rich than face the reality of being poor.” – John Dickinson</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As was pointed out to me a few months ago, the American dream wasn’t always the greedy acquisition of money up to and including disadvantaging other people to reach that goal; it was originally the right to live without fear of persecution, with the ability to persue one’s individual dreams and aspirations.</p>

<p>To clarify a bit further, I’m not advocating scrapping capitalism in favor of a socialist system. I’m merely pointing out that prostrating ourselves at the altar of pure, unbridled capitalism has a very predictable outcoming — the upward movement of money from a large pool of people with a decent amount of money to a very small group of people with far more money than they could ever spend. Rules and regulations in America have existed since the genesis of this nation to attempt to keep those with power from using that power to harm or disenfranchise those without power. “Conservatives” who would prefer to strip the Federal government of oversight power do so at an incredible harm to those who are not fortunate enough to be born into or exploit their way into money.</p>

<p>Lastly, I’d like to put to bed another notion about Capitalism and taxation which has been irritating me… Those on the top of the financial food chain seem to be very unhappy about shouldering a larger percentage of the tax burden than those on the lower end of the spectrum. There’s a very simple explaination to this, which brings everything very sharply into focus:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>In capitalist societies, those who are rich make their money off the backs of poor people.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>No one is worth 10 million dollars a year — they simply can’t produce goods and/or services to equal that number. A banker never really *produces* anything for anyone, instead taking the role of enabling production by loaning money to those who would actually produce goods and services. That is, if they are actually lending money to anyone. Something seems really wrong with banks having CEOs earning tens of millions of dollars or more. I think if they weren’t hating the idea of universal healthcare because they might be a few mansions short of keeping up with their snooty CEO friends paying for their share, they might not be such bad people. But back in reality, they’re just horrible people.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just came back from an impromptu trip to Fort Lauderdale to attend the funeral service for my grandfather, Israel “Irving” Liss. He was born in a small town in Russia on December 20, 1917, and survived a pogram, emmigration to Israel, and eventually moved to Brooklyn. He was a professional soccer player, playing for the New York Americans after coming back from decorated service in the 101st Airborne paratroopers. And I did not know most of this a week ago.</p>

<figure class="flickr-thumbnail" style="width: 172px;"><a href="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3426/3270641571_c21ed63484_z.jpg" class="fancybox" data-title-id="flickr-photo-3270641571" data-media="photo"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3426/3270641571_c21ed63484_m.jpg" title="In uniform" style="width: 172px; height: 240px;" /></a><figcaption id="flickr-photo-3270641571"><h1><a class="flickr-link" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90594090@N00/3270641571">In uniform</a> by What&#8217;s Your Meme</h1><div class="description">As a young man in the 101st Airborne in World War II.

From the collection of Israel &quot;Irving&quot; Liss.</div></figcaption></figure>

<p>For reasons which still aren’t apparent to me now, familial estrangement kept me from knowing my grandfather as well as I would have liked. I do remember his dry humor, his penchant for anything vintage or collectable, and his kindness to me, no matter what the circumstances. I’m happy to have reconnected with my uncle and cousins… But I think I’d be foolish not to carry a lesson away from all of this: never take your family for granted, you only get one of them, and it’s surprising the things you wished you knew about them until it’s too late.</p>

<p>*Update: I put an entire set of photos online of this, and am posting more as I receive them — *</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of my pictures made it to the front page of the infamous “<a href="http://failblog.org/">failblog</a>“, consisting of <a href="http://failblog.org/2009/01/20/reputable-kids-program-fail/">a picture of a very disreputable looking van</a> with “Little Angels Program” spraypainted on the side. I had caught that image earlier in 2008 in Willimantic, CT while I was walking through the hill section.</p>

<p>It’s not Life or the New York Times or anything, but I’ll take what I can get. Probably should have color corrected that one before I sent it in …</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just posted 24 tracks (some are multiple versions of the same tracks) from the 2005 incarnation of the studio on mediafire. It’s mostly Jake, Natasha and I. A good deal of backing tracks provided by other musicians, featuring Bob Thurston on violin.</p>
