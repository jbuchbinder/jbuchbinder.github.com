I’ve had three laptops bite the big one in the last week or so. Not software related at all. One stopped working entirely and won’t even turn on, another has a completely non-functional display, and a third ate a hard drive … completely (and has a shot power supply to boot). I’m finally back online on a fourth machine, as evidenced by this posting.

The time away from a machine gave me a little time to reflect exactly how dependent I am on such incredibly fragile machines to be able to function in certain important ways. I can’t work unless I have a working machine, but I also use it for some socialization functions (email mostly) and creative things (music and design). If I had been born fifty years earlier, would I even remotely resemble the person I am today, who is so intrinsically linked to these machines?

I found it very interesting to see how I instinctively went over to look at the machines, though they were dark and cold, as though I was programmed to look at them. Somewhere in the distance, a bell is ringing, and I’m drooling. Makes me glad I don’t watch more television …
