This saturday night I had the pleasure of going to see [Gordon Bok][1], one of the finest living folk singer/songwriters, at the Connecticut Audubon Society location in Glastonbury. I’ve been a fan of his since his [Bok/Muir/Trickett][2] days, and haven’t gotten a chance to see him live since seeing him at [The Sounding Board][3]. And yes, his voice is just as awesome as it was back then, and his storytelling skills have improved with time.

Besides two children who were dragged by their parents, I was the youngest person in the room by at least ten or fifteen years, which was a little disconcerting. I did, however, get to sit in the third row and get some great shots. They’ll be up on flickr when I get the chance.
