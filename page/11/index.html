<p>I’ve had a Sprint Motorola RAZR v3m for a while, and when the time came to move to a Blackberry (for work), getting the information off of it would have been a horrendous process.</p>

<p>Instead, I present a pretty simple way of doing this using the Subversion version of opensync’s sync-moto script. Note that I did this under Ubuntu 7.10 (Gutsy Gibbon):</p>

<p>• Get the id by using lsusb:<br/>
$ <strong>lsusb</strong><br/>
Bus 005 Device 001: ID 0000:0000<br/>
Bus 003 Device 001: ID 0000:0000<br/>
Bus 002 Device 001: ID 0000:0000<br/>
Bus 004 Device 003: ID 0483:2016 SGS Thomson Microelectronics Fingerprint Reader<br/>
Bus 004 Device 002: ID 0a5c:2110 Broadcom Corp.<br/>
Bus 004 Device 001: ID 0000:0000<br/>
Bus 001 Device 003: ID 22b8:2a64 Motorola PCS<br/>
Bus 001 Device 002: ID 046d:0a02 Logitech, Inc.<br/>
Bus 001 Device 001: ID 0000:0000<br/>
• Add the following definition under /etc/modprobe.d/somethingorother :<br/>
<strong>alias cdc_acm usbserial<br/>
options vendor=0x22b8 product=0x2a64</strong><br/>
• Plug in the phone and issue a:<br/>
<strong> sudo /sbin/modprobe cdc_acm vendor=0x22b8 product=0x2a64</strong><br/>
• Download the Subversion copy of the opensync moto-sync plugin from:</p>

<p><a href="https://svn.opensync.org/plugins/moto-sync/">https://svn.opensync.org/plugins/moto-sync/</a></p>

<p>• Issue the following sync command:<br/>
<strong>./mototool -d /dev/ttyUSB0 –backup –file mybackupfile.csv</strong></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1></h1>

<p>I had a bit of a revelation the other day. Natasha and I had gone to pick up food to bring to a small dinner party, although it wasn’t a very formal occasion. She, on a lark, decided to grab one of those ridiculous celebrity tabloid-type magazines to read in the car on the way over.</p>

<p>The cashier, who looked to be somewhere between her mid forties and fifties, reacted with much excitement, and started talking to Natasha about some of the celebrities mentioned on the cover. None of this would have been very interesting, until I hear her start defending one of them. She said that it “wasn’t fair” that they were treating the celebrity “like that”, and that “she’s too good for that”. As if she knew her.</p>

<p>And something that has made a lot of sense to a lot of other people finally clicked in my head. A forty to fifty year old woman working a dead end cashiering job in the middle of nowhere doesn’t have anything to look forward to, and probably won’t ever attain any measure of fame and fortune. But by living vicariously through the glossy images in the impulse purchase area, she gets to feel as though she has some great connection. I used to think that welfare and Jerry Springer were our modern day bread and circus combination, but maybe that’s not it.</p>

<p>When you feel that you’re part of something bigger than yourself, you have some sort of purpose, and that the Universe is a sane, fair and rational place. You ignore poverty, poor health, overwork and stress, and instead focus on a place where the Universe revolves around you. Not exactly a “<a href="http://www.damninteresting.com/?p=864">Total Perspective Vortex</a>“, if you catch my drift. Maybe it’s just as much a way of getting by as betting the house on a better afterlife, or blowing all of your spare change on lottery tickets. I can’t exactly complain about it, since I think the perception of happiness trumps the reality of misery almost every time.</p>

<p>Pass the remote control, I’m tired of this station.</p>

<p>If you’ve got an old junky XBox around, and would like to put something, well, *useful* on it, like XBMC, then I’ve got a great link for you which allows soft modding without having a copy of any of the exploitable games.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?ybytdtnmt93">Patched xboxhdm 1.9 with exploits</a> will allow you to boot another PC while hotswapping your XBox hard drive into that machine. It has all of the known exploits on it, I believe, so you don’t have to have your XBox connected to another machine or anything, nice and simple. After that, use a fully automated installer like <a href="http://aideluxe.com/">Auto Installer Deluxe</a> to do everything else for you.</p>

<p>So, don’t throw that XBox out, make it into something much better.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1></h1>

<p>I’m not a big fan of tomcat, preferring <a href="http://www.mortbay.org/">Jetty</a> where possible. Unfortunately there are a lot of catches involved with getting <a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/">GWT</a> applications working. I’ll try to break the changes down here. This assumes that you already have a GWT project built and made with projectCreator which you are migrating into Jetty.</p>

<p>1) Pull the start.jar, bin/jetty.sh script (which will be moved to the base of your distribution), lib and etc directories from your Jetty distribution, and put them in $DIST (your distribution directory)</p>

<p>2) Change your (appname)-shell script to be like the following:<br/>
<strong>JettyTest-shell</strong><br/>
&#8220;</p>

<h1>!/bin/sh</h1>

<p>GWT_HOME=/usr/lib/gwt
ENTRY_POINT=net.cognitiveconsulting.gwt.JettyTest
HOST_PAGE=JettyTest.html
APPDIR=<code>dirname $0</code>;
CPGWT=$APPDIR/src
CPGWT=$CPGWT:$GWT_HOME/gwt-user.jar
CPGWT=$CPGWT:$GWT_HOME/gwt-dev-linux.jar
java -cp $CPGWT com.google.gwt.dev.GWTShell -logLevel DEBUG -noserver -port 8080 &ldquo;$@&rdquo; $ENTRY_POINT/$HOST_PAGE
&#8220;</p>

<p>3) Change your (appname)-compile script to look like:<br/>
<strong>JettyTest-compile</strong><br/>
&#8220;</p>

<h1>!/bin/sh</h1>

<p>APPDIR=<code>dirname $0</code>;
echo &ldquo;Compiling GWT portion of application &hellip; &rdquo;
java  -cp &ldquo;$APPDIR/src:$APPDIR/bin:/usr/lib/gwt/gwt-user.jar:/usr/lib/gwt/gwt-dev-linux.jar&rdquo; com.google.gwt.dev.GWTCompiler -out &ldquo;$APPDIR/webapps&rdquo; &ldquo;$@&rdquo; net.cognitiveconsulting.gwt.JettyTest;
echo &ldquo;Compiling native Java part of application &hellip; &rdquo;
ant -f net.cognitiveconsulting.gwt.JettyTest.ant.xml
echo &ldquo;Moving pieces into Jetty library path &hellip; &rdquo;
( cd bin ; jar cf ../lib/net.cognitiveconsulting.gwt.JettyTest.jar * )
&#8220;</p>

<p>Remember, after this, your output directory is no longer www, it’s now “webapps”.</p>

<p>4) Create the directory $DIST/webapps/(appname)/WEB-INF, and create a web.xml file like this, with the definitions for your remote services:<br/>
<strong>webapps/net.cognitiveconsulting.gwt.JettyTest/WEB-INF/web.xml</strong></p>

<pre><code>[servlet]
    [servlet-name]Test[/servlet-name]
    [servlet-class]net.cognitiveconsulting.gwt.server.TestImpl[/servlet-class]
  [/servlet]

  [servlet-mapping]
    [servlet-name]Test[/servlet-name]
    [url-pattern]/rpc/net.cognitiveconsulting.gwt.client.Test[/url-pattern]
  [/servlet-mapping]
</code></pre>

<p>(Please note that because wordpress ate my XML, I used a different kind of brackets, please substitute as required.)</p>

<p>5) Create the ant build file:<br/>
<code>/usr/lib/gwt/projectCreator -ant net.cognitiveconsulting.gwt.JettyTest</code></p>

<p>6) Make sure you have created working servlets under the internal tomcat implementation before you proceed, making sure that the servlet information is in the .gwt.xml file in your source directory like this:<br/>
&#8220;</p>

<p>7) Make sure that a copy of $GWTDIR/gwt-servlet.jar and any other libraries you are using are installed in $DIST/lib — forget this and nothing is going to work.</p>

<p>8) Create an empty “logs” directory under $DIST.</p>

<p>You should be able to start Jetty at your convenience and browse to the (appname)/(startpage).html page. If you want to pack it as a war, just zip the (appname) directory in $DIST/webapps with a .war extension. Also, running jetty.sh with the parameter “supervise” will allow you to watch the logs as they go by.</p>

<p>Hope this has been informative and helpful.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: <em>Jan, one of the webtide guys, was nice enough to send me an ant build file which does much the same type of thing I was attempting to do here. It is attached <a href="http://jbuchbinder.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/build.xml">here</a>, for anyone else who would like a copy.</em></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1></h1>

<p>There seems to be an almost delectable thread of irony heading through my life as I head into Thanksgiving Day. Strangely enough, a few days ago I could have spouted for what would have seemed hours at all of the wonderful things to be thankful for, but somehow enough things have happened to come to a head that the same time that it’s a bit more difficult to extract the wheat from the chaff.</p>

<p>I guess I can’t pretend to be surprised about not being appreciated at work; apparently the majority of Americans are unhappy with work, but it doesn’t help the spirit of Thanksgiving to find out you were passed over for promotion *again*. Couldn’t it wait until *after* the holiday for once?</p>

<p>Then a long time friend turns out to only talk to you when he needs something … There’s no surprise in that, until you find out that he’s going to great lengths to abscond with something and avoid communicating with you at all. That’s just not necessary. Couldn’t we save some of these wonderful gifts for Christmas?</p>

<p>Another friend is moving away, and can’t be bothered to call you before he leaves. I couldn’t make up something this ill-timed if I tried…</p>

<p>So what am I left with? I’m going to finish this posting the same way every other glib Thanksgiving post has ended for as long as there have been glib Thanksgiving posts; by explaining all of the things that I *am* grateful for, after disregarding all of the awful things I’ve seen fit to grouse about.</p>

<p>Family looks like it’s the only thing you can count on. Whether natural or adopted, human or animal, your family is just about the only thing you can count on, no matter how bad times get. <em>(Unless you’ve got parents like the Ramseys or Yates, in which case, run like hell.)</em></p>

<p>Ugh. This is what getting older feels like — everything turns out all sweet and saccharine, no matter how bitter and corrosive it started out.</p>

<p>The Nokia 770 turned up as a prop in the summer movie “Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer”. Having read the actual source material, I can’t say I was impressed by the movie, but I really have to give credit to anyone who would feature a gadget like the 770 in anything. I saw a few livejournal entries on the same subject, but they seemed to like it. Well, if I’m going so far as to admit that I actually not only watched this particular stinker, but actually paid enough attention to see a Nokia 770 …</p>

<p>I take no credit for this at all, but the maintainer of the go7007 linux driver recently added support for the ADS DVD Xpress DX2 (which until recently was conveniently available at Walmart and other retail stores) after I took a picture of the board and asked him *very* nicely. If you get any kind of mileage out of it and decide that you really *have* to send someone money, please send it to him. (To avoid spam, check out the name of the package maintainer.)</p>

<p>I’m posting a copy of this as a kind of public service, since I haven’t seen any upstream releases in a while. Disclaimer that your mileage may very. I have had great luck with this, and have used it to preserve old VHS content … I would also recommend using the <a href="http://colabti.de/convertx/">ffrecord</a> tool, since it has better av sync than the included tools.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1></h1>

<p>My dog <a href="http://jbuchbinder.com/pets/ebony">Ebony</a> passed away today at 8:00pm EDT (Thursday, June 21, 2007). He was sixteen years old.</p>

<p>He lived a very well <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/whatsyourmeme/tags/ebony">documented</a> life. Natasha rescued him from being drowned along with the rest of his brothers and sisters when he was a month old, and bottle fed him until he was old enough to eat food on his own.</p>

<p>It took me a long time to get him acclimated to me, since he never really had to get used to anyone, but I played the guitar and sang to him every day until he accepted me. From that day on, he used to sleep next to me or at my feet and guarded me as though his life depended on it.</p>

<p>I promised him that I wouldn’t let him die alone, since I figured that the most awful thing for anyone would be to die alone. In April he was diagnosed with terminal meta-static tumors. One nice veterinarian suggested that since he wasn’t in pain, I should just bring him home and let him live out the rest of his life until he died peacefully. Today he didn’t eat or drink at all, and collapsed after I carried him in from the outdoors. He bled out and died in my arms; I pet his head the whole time.</p>

<p>Its often said that everyone thinks that their pet is special, or that their pet has some amazing personality. Ebony was a very unique dog, and did touch all those with whom he came in contact. <a href="http://jbuchbinder.com/pets/stan">Stan</a> is beside himself, and can’t figure out what’s wrong. He keeps looking for Ebony, but can’t find him. I wonder if he has any concept of mortality, or could understand that he’s never going to see him again.</p>

<p>Ebony wasn’t judgmental like most people or animals, but seemed to know whether or not a person was capable of good things, and measured them by that. I wish most people were as wonderful and understanding as he was. Every time I wonder if knowing people or having pets is worth the pain of loss and death, I remember the moments he gave me with no quarter. I can’t regret something as wonderful as him, no matter how painful the end, no matter how hard I cry.</p>

<p>I have never been in the room when any person or animal has died ; I always made sure that I was somewhere else, since I didn’t think I would be able to handle it. Ebony went very gracefully, and looked almost peaceful. I shut his eyes for him when I got up to cover him.</p>

<p>It’s almost disturbing that after someone dies, many people seem to come out of the proverbial woodwork to mourn them. I suppose it’s natural that there’s a tinge of regret at not being able to express yourself to someone anymore, not being able to apologize for some real or even imagined transgression.</p>

<p>But there’s also a line. When did it become nouveau chic to get choked up at a funeral of an acquaintance? (I’m talking to you, <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=emo">crying emo kid</a>. You didn’t even know him well enough to sob like your mom killed your dog.) Are you really crass enough to stand outside a funeral and hawk your barbecue to the mourners? Are you really that much of a terrible human being that you will wait your turn, to start your eulogy with “I never actually met him, but …” ?</p>

<p>“But, where’s your sensitivity?”, you cry, in some sort of mock outrage. We all are saddened by the death of a loved one, a friend, a colleague, even a <a href="http://www.vonnegutweb.com/">celebrity</a> whom we may have admired. Then again, there is a line … where does this change from grief to showboating? Is your grief bigger and better than mine? Can you be sadder than I?</p>

<p>The Jewish tradition of ×¦×“×§×” (pronounced tzedakah) holds that to give, one must give without the knowledge of the receiving party, else it would constitute a selfish act, committed for the gratification of the giver. This falls in the same category of action. Grief and pain are not to be bottled up and hidden, but also not to be paraded around like a set of Boy Scout merit badges. Get your humanity back, it’ll feel a lot better to think that when you die, your funeral will contain somewhat more reality than a Milli Vanilli album. Or maybe, just maybe, you’re a terrible person, live a terrible life, and the only way you’ll be remembered in a kind way is to have a bunch of faking sycophants lined up to give mock eulogies. Don’t worry — time will take care of that question for you.</p>
