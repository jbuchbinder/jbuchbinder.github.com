As for lenses for the Canon EOS bodies, my current collection includes (this is, by no means, a complete list):

## EF Mount

*   **Canon EF 50mm f/1.8**. Great portrait lens. Also known as the "plastic fantastic", among cheap lens afficionados.
*   **Canon EF 50mm f/1.4**. Nicer version of the 50mm f/1.8. Great for low-light shooting.
*   **Canon EF 28-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USM**. Came with the 40D, and is now my primary kit lens.
*   **[Canon EF 70-200mm f/2.8 L IS USM II](http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/consumer/products/cameras/ef_lens_lineup/ef_70_200mm_f_2_8l_is_ii_usm)**. My long lens, affectionately referred to as my "wedding lens" or "the bazooka". This tends to get a lot of use for portrait shots, as well.
*   **[Canon EF 135mm f/2.8 soft focus](http://www.the-digital-picture.com/Reviews/Canon-EF-135mm-f-2.8-with-Softfocus-Lens-Review.aspx)**. Got this lens grey market from Korea. I don't use it *all* the time, but when I need a specialty vintage shot, this is my go-to lens. Why use Photoshop when you can do everything in-camera? 
*   **Rokinon EF 14mm T/3.1 Cine**, **Rokinon EF 24mm T/1.5 Cine**, **Rokinon EF 35mm T/1.5mm T/1.5 Cine**. These are my set of Rokinon "Cine" lenses. I primarily use them for cinematography, but I have been known to use them for stills on occasion.
*   **Rokinon 85mm f/1.4**. Upon reflection, I would rather have bought the de-clicked f/1.5 cine version of this, but it's a really great, really bright lens.

## FD Mount

*Old Canon FD mount lenses. Very bright, very sharp, but require a Lens Doctor adapter to work with my EF mount. I primarily use them with my BMPCC for cinematography, but sometimes break them out for stills.*

*   **[Canon FD 28mm f/2.0](http://www.mir.com.my/rb/photography/companies/canon/fdresources/fdlenses/28mm.htm)**.
*   **Canon FD 50mm f/1.2**.

## Nikon F/G Mount

*   **Vivitar 135mm f/2.8** It’s a Nikon-mount lens attached to a 5$ chinese adapter ring. It takes fantastic black and white shots, and is my favorite piece-of-crap 7$ lens.
*   **[Nikkor 55mm f/1.2](http://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/55mm-f12.htm)**. Beautifully, wonderfully imperfect. For photos featuring this lens, check out the [nikkor55mmf12](https://www.flickr.com/photos/whatsyourmeme/tags/nikkor55mmf12/) Flickr tag.

## M42 Mount

*   **Asahi Super Takumar M42 50mm f/1.4**. One of my M42 / Pentax screw-mount lenses; a present from my sister-in-law, off of eBay.
*   **[Sears 28mm f/2.8](http://forum.mflenses.com/auto-sears-28mm-f2-8-who-made-these-t54077.html)**. A rebadged Tokina lens, from what I can gather.
*   **Soliger 135mm f/2.8 with 2x teleconverter**. I’m not really that fond of this lens. It’s a Pentax screw-mount lens, also attached to a 5$ chinese adapter ring. The teleconverter is okay, but this lens combination has mostly been phased out in favor of the Tamron. Especially since I think it’s a bit wobbly.

*I’m sure there are others, but I can’t think of them right now...*
