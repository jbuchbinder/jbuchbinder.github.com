  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’ve never been one to take risks in any part of my life. Somehow, I’ve always taken the safe road, and unlike the Frost poem, I’m not the better off for having done it. Even small things, I seem unwilling to extend past a limited view of what is safe and comfortable — and now I can’t help but feel that I’m not living up to whatever potential I’m supposed to have. Surrounded by barriers of my own design, it feels like no matter how much is accomplished, how much is gained, how much is experienced, everything is somehow limited, muted, dulled. Barring any transcendence to another form or other transference of consciousness, we all have a limited number of minutes and seconds.</p>

<p>Infinite possibilities collapse every moment to form the existence we live, and every moment we have the ability to shape what we are to become, and in a limited way, affect everything else in the universe. The question of perception in all of this is whether or not everything we’re supposed to be is being lived out by taking the safe, well trodden path, or if we’re cheating ourselves. Is there such a thing as potential, or is it just an idea to help feed the drive to keep away from complacency? Is the way to happiness some form of success, or is that just taking away from the time we have to enjoy ourselves?</p>

<p>Maybe it’s just that some part of me wants to think how I’ll be remembered or thought about when I’m not around to say anything. Maybe everyone thinks that they’re more complex or have more inside, or something that is worth remembering which doesn’t always bubble to the surface. Maybe immortality is having children, maybe your works, maybe nothing.</p>

<p>No answers, only questions … The easiest way to describe it was the glib “half the fun is the journey.” So long and thanks for the existentialism?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>President Bush (god, it still sounds so awful to say it) just gave the traditional sixth-year “we lost our majority” speech to the nation, with the addition of the announcement of Donald Rumsfeld’s resignation as Secretary of Defense. Many people will remember Rumsfeld as the jackass who condoned torture (or sought to redefine it), pushed the notion of “weapons of mass destruction” in Iraq, and sought to push forward ideas like the “PATRIOT Act”. He couldn’t be gone soon enough for me. I wonder if this keeps him away from prosecution for war crimes, unless we’ve somehow outlawed that.</p>

<p>Bush used the phrase “we cannot accept defeat in Iraq.” I think it’s incredibly indicative of his views on reality, and even more insightful on the state of his entire presidency. He said that we couldn’t <strong>accept</strong> defeat, not that we would not avoid it. Many could argue that the campaign in Iraq has been plagued by <a href="http://www.halliburtonwatch.org/">corruption</a> and <a href="http://www.iraqbodycount.org/">failure</a>, and that by any measure of “success”, the United States wasn’t really achieving it, whatever it is or was.</p>

<p>Hopefully this will force bills which will be difficult to attack to be brought up for either the now traditional presidential signing statement, or more hopefully, a veto. I mean, if a law were to be passed which repealed the reprehensible pieces of things like the “PATRIOT Act” and the “Military Commissions Act of 2006″. Of course, we still could see defense of torturing human beings, spying on American citizens who have done nothing wrong, profiling of muslims, and other things which the often-referenced “founding fathers” would denounce with every last breath.</p>

<p>Not to bring comparisons to <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~h5jukebox/george3.mp3">another historical character with the same name</a>, but President Bush seems to be making strides towards becoming <a href="http://uniorb.com/RCHECK/kingbush.htm">King Bush</a>. Before this is denounced as paranoid conspiracy-oriented rambling, consider the evidence… When the United States was founded, it was founded mainly due to landowners having issues with a King who seemed removed from reality being able to override rule of legislature, being able to declare military rule at any point, and being able to imprison and/or hurt them in some way <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admiralty_court">without the benefit</a> of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habeus_corpus">trial by peers</a>. As of now, the President has all of those powers, under the guise of fighting “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Terrorism">international terrorism</a>.” When we started invading other countries to push our own domestic agenda, I think <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/usa/story/0,,1938434,00.html">we started becoming the “international terrorists.”</a> Our populace has remained terrorized; most people voting for Bush in 2004 cited his handling of “the War on Terror” as their reason for reelecting him to the Presidency (any <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_U.S._presidential_election_controversy_and_irregularities">allegations of impropriety</a> aside). Usually I’m pretty disappointed in things like that ; today, I’ll take the changes we’re getting at face value. I’m just happy that a single party doesn’t have control over all three branches of the United States Government, especially not one with such cavalier disregard for the Constitution.</p>

<p>As someone on <a href="http://slashdot.org/">slashdot</a> pointed out, not living in the United States doesn’t exempt you from its influence, just in your ability to influence it by your vote. Let’s hope that the United States leadership takes their new positions of responsibility with a bit more seriousness than their previous counterparts had.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’ve just done the one thing which I feel sets me apart from many more unfortunate people in other countries: voted. I got to go to a polling location and cast my single vote for whomever I feel would be the best person, or at least not the <a href="http://www.joe2006.com/">worst person</a>, for the job. I mean, government can <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_Commissions_Act_of_2006">strip my rights to a fair trial or any civil rights</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Warner_National_Defense_Authorization_Act_for_Fiscal_Year_2007">declare martial law</a> at will, so I think voting to oust the bastards who passed this kind of constitution-screwing garbage is the least of my rights, no, *responsibilities* as a citizen of this country.</p>

<p>Since everyone else likes to quote the venerable “founding fathers”, I’ll quote Benjamin Franklin: “<em>Those who would give up Essential Liberty to purchase a little Temporary Safety deserve neither Liberty nor Safety</em>“. We’ve obviously given up essential liberties, and perhaps purchased a little temporary safety. Perhaps. (Not for anyone actually getting shot at, but I guess we’ve bought some time for the rest of us couch jockeys.) Do we really deserve the freedoms with which we have been blessed by men with far more foresight than we?</p>

<p>Election day isn’t just a great day because it’s the day when the stupid attack ads and <a href="http://www.crooksandliars.com/2006/11/06/cnn-gives-coverage-to-the-robocall-scam/">robodialing</a> stops, it’s the day when my point of view becomes a part of the public, and when I have the chance to finally allow my actions to speak louder than my words. I won’t advocate that anyone vote for a particular candidate, but I won’t tell people not to vote or <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15603344/">that they can’t vote</a>. Depriving people of their constitutional rights is one of the worst things apart from physical harm which can be afflicted in a working representative democracy.</p>

<p>For crying out loud, get up off your couch or chair, get to the polls. If you don’t make yourself heard, someone else with a louder voice will take that away from you. And if you’re planning on having children, don’t “<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/columnist/andrewkantor/2004-07-08-kantor_x.htm">think of the children</a>” only when some politician <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/6072326.stm">scares you</a> enough to believe that voting for them will keep the kiddie-philes away; think of them when you consider the legacy that you will leave them. Our constitution is a living, breathing document, which is effected by every law passed, every judgment made, every breath taken. We need to make sure that what we and our forefathers have had, ever since they immigrated to this country (since we all are immigrants, to one degree or another): liberty. Don’t try to <a href="http://www.khilafah.com/home/category.php?DocumentID=9720&amp;TagID=24">export</a> what we can’t keep for ourselves.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>With less than a month remaining before the midterm congressional elections, one could argue that not much has actually changed in the United States. I mean, we still are passing awful legislation (Military Appropriations Act of 2006, stripping habeus corpus at will) and still <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/empsit_10062006.pdf">not making people any less poor</a>.</p>

<p>What has changed, as it does before every election, is the amount of rampant sucking up to the regular plebes of this country. Driving to drop my niece and nephew off today, I saw an incredible plethora of signs for political candidates, both on the state level and the federal level. I mean, the sheer amount of cardboard and metal used to put up these ridiculous political signs, festooned in red, white and blue, must be incredible. Then it struck me: there wasn’t a difference between the signs. No one was espousing political gold, telling of their stances against tyranny and oppression or trying to defend their past record ; this was pure name recognition. I would be remiss in thinking that the majority of Americans care about their political process at all. For the most part, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamarckism">children tend to inherit their parents’ viewpoints on a lot of things, including politics</a>. So we get the dog and pony show, with candidates going through the old, tired routine of trying to convince Joe and Marie Six-pack that they are a thousand times better than the guy they voted for last time.</p>

<p>The only piece of sanity and reason that I saw was a <a href="http://www.ct.gov/dot/site/default.asp">DOT</a> truck, with a worker picking signs up off the road and throwing them in the back of a large orange truck. In the end, all the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/14/AR2006101401051_pf.html">campaigning</a>, <a href="http://lamontblog.blogspot.com/2006/08/lieberman-running-out-of-spite-for.html">sloganing</a>, <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2004/03/21/the_anatomy_of_a_smear_campaign?mode=PF">mudslinging</a>, <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/index.shtm">fearmongering</a> and <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/cgi-bin/print.cgi?file=/views05/0519-24.htm">gerrymandering</a> comes down to <a href="http://www.tray.com/cgi-win/x_candidate.exe?DoFn=&amp;sYR=2006">how much money you have in your coffers</a> or <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/custom/redeye/red-081106-greenfield,1,6734440,print.column?coll=chi-news-hed&amp;ctrack=1&amp;cset=true">how scared your voters are</a>. (Really, why in the world is our Homeland Security alert status at “elevated”? We’re “<a href="http://www.libertypost.org/cgi-bin/readart.cgi?ArtNum=160408">fighting them over there</a>” after all…) But in the end, it’s not about that. Your candidate, my candidate, everyone’s candidate — their posters will end up in the trash bin, along with most of their last minute promises.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I tuned in Fox News on the old “Radiation King” television on a lark around 4:30 AM Eastern Standard Time, out of some form of morbid curiosity. I’ve heard a lot of ranting and raving from both proponents and opponents of their reporting and the questioned quality of their reporting, but like anything else, it is best to see this sort of thing and make your own decisions.</p>

<p>What I found was rhetoric and montage shots of soldiers and waving flags. The story was one on Donald Rumsfeld (the current Administration’s Secretary of Defense) and the possibility that he would be replaced before the end of the current Administration. The reporter asked questions like “since the next administration will certainly not be as vigilant in the war on terror, how do you intend to deal with it(sic)” and “what do you think of the American people(sic)”; questions which are so glib and meaningless as to not require the effort of being asked. The reporter seemed to be more interested in aggrandizing the politician for his efforts in “Donald Rumsfeld’s … America’s … War on Terror”. As I have stated before, wars on abstract concepts have been poor ideas in past and continue to be poor ideas.</p>

<p>Strangely, I haven’t heard anything in any of the local papers or mainstream news regarding the house and <a href="http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=109&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00259">senate</a> passing <a href="/2006/09/29/partisanship-dooms-us-all/">the closest thing to outright totalitarianism</a> I have seen in a long time, and it’s pretty obvious that not only the majority of the congress, but also the majority of the media, seem to be pretty intimately aquainted with the Administration’s posterior. I don’t give much credit to the idea of “blogging” news (blogging, of course, being one of my least favorite pseudo-words, right up there with “webinar” and “podcast”), but I can’t possibly think that the jokers who are paid salaries to do this sort of thing are doing an acceptable job.</p>

<p>I sense the <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/61/39/B0463950.html">Roman ethos</a> making an awful resurgence through the trumpeting of news stories about <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0821/p03s01-ussc.html">ten-year dead beauty queens</a> that don’t impact people at large (an example of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_white_woman_syndrome">missing white-woman syndrome</a>, I suppose) and horrible brown-nosing “portraits” of public figures, such as the aforementioned interview with Donald Rumsfeld (not the first, I might add). Throw a couple tax rebates in there, <a href="http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/2005/gas_prices48.html">drop gasoline prices</a> from their <a href="http://www.becker-posner-blog.com/archives/2005/10/price_gouging_i.html">artificially induced high</a> point a little, and watch <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2006-09-18-bush-poll_x.htm">approval ratings soar</a> … or at least come close enough to keep a rival political party from <a href="http://www.ourcongress.org/special/top10">keeping you in check</a>. All of this to mask passing of legislation to decriminalize the conversion of the United States Constitution and its Bill of Rights to pieces of legislative toilet paper, and the passing of basic rights into the realm of history.</p>

<p>Normally, this is the point where “bloggers” tell you to vote for the other jokers. As my brother once put, “when you have an incumbent who eats babies, you vote for the guy who doesn’t eat babies (sic)”. The problem with that is, I don’t think that the Democratic party is going to do much better than the ruling party right now. Sure, you can have some of your rights back, assuming that the Supreme Court comes to its senses and strikes down the latest piece of Congressional <a href="http://buckfush.com/">Bush-kissing</a>, and *maybe* you might get a withdrawl, or perhaps even the *plan* of withdrawl from an <a href="http://www.iraqbodycount.com/">ever-deepening quagmire</a> after the Chief Executive leaves office (since he has made it very clear that <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/03/21/politics/main1425182.shtml">any withdrawl or resolution would come from a successor</a>). The issue is that the current crop of Democrats in Congress are obviously willing to pass Republican agenda legislation (even after they vehemently debate about it, as seen in Arlen Spector), even when it is contrary to everything for which they supposedly stand. I’d like my Congressional representative to actually represent me, thank you. That’s the point of a Representative Democracy, not to vote along with whomever is least likely to paint you as a terrorist-friendly pinko in the public eye, and Swift-Boat you out of office …. I don’t understand how 30% or more of the United States can’t see that. </p>

<p>A third party would be a wonderful idea … if they could come up with something comprehensive. The Green Party is more of a local joke than anything else, since they don’t really have strong political views on whatever voters seem to care about ; hugging a tree and talking about cutting emissions while Americans are complaining about gasoline prices just doesn’t do it. Could someone *please* try running candidates who aren’t <a href="http://www.nedlamont.com/">one-note songs</a>, which although better than the <a href="http://www.joe2006.com/">current civil-rights hating jerkasses</a> that they are running against, don’t evoke true passion and commitment from voters by actually connecting with them on a broad range of issues? I’m slowly witnessing the death of our Representative Democracy through a system where <a href="http://www.abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=2428375&amp;page=1">only primaries truly determine the majority of political candidates</a> due to the predominance of incumbents winning races. I can only think that this has to do with our own inertia and unwillingness to participate in the political process, and indeed in the running of our own country.</p>

<p>But back to the media, and in particular Fox News. For some reason, this isn’t in the public consciousness. If I ask a random person, I doubt they will bring up any of these issues or express distaste with the current administration, with the exception of the items which directly effect them. For a company which runs drivel like “<em>American Idol</em>” and “<em>Jerry Springer</em>“, where fame and infamy are comingled with impugnity, it struck me as odd that they would be for censorship and religious agenda — until it hit me that it’s a slight-of-hand trick. If you’re watching these nonsense “documentary pieces” and shows of people who are obviously more pathetic than you, you aren’t in the process of caring about how your country is run. You’ll vote for whoever pulls your heartstrings and purse string. I guess that’s why I don’t watch Fox News; I just can’t bear it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Apparently, fear of partisan political reprisal trumps constitutional rights, decency, and a host of other important things in the lastest failure of the United States’ legislative branch to keep insanity out of our lawbooks.</p>

<p>Both political parties seem to have failed us horribly. Republicans sided with a corrupt and out-of-control administration in an effort to bolster itself against possible defeat in midterm elections, while Democrats, afraid of being considered “light on terror”, only put up a limp-wristed struggle, with the bill in question passing easily.</p>

<p>The “evil” in question is the Military Appropriations Act of 2006, which allows anyone, even a citizen of the United States, to be declared a “lawful enemy combatant”, and therefore be stripped of all civil rights and due process. Many have said that this sets us back “900 years … by denying habeas corpus (sic)” to pre <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magna_Carta">Magna Carta</a> status. A nice, simple review of what this bill does is <a href="http://glenngreenwald.blogspot.com/2006/09/legalization-of-torture-an_115945829460324274.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>I probably shouldn’t be speaking out against this, since doing so might inadvertantly classify me as one of these supposed “enemy combatants”. It’s a shame when an awful legal loophole can be expanded like this to allow uncontrolled expansion of Executive power. I, for one, advocate the use of encryption technologies like <a href="http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/">OTR</a> for IM communication, <a href="http://tor.eff.org/">TOR</a> for web browsing, and anything else you can get your hands on to keep yourself away from the overextended reach of the overzealous executive branch.</p>

<p>Maybe, upon midterm elections in this country, we can try to reclaim what is rightfully ours — the liberties guaranteed to us by the Bill of Rights. I urge anyone living in the United States to vote against any incumbent official who voted for or advocated this bill in whole or in part. I used to think that the root of the problem was the neoconservative administration in power, but I’m starting to realize that there are very few who cannot help shoulder the blame for the enormous trench we’re digging ourselves into. How can people envy your liberties and freedoms when you’re more than willing to trade them cheaply for a little inferred temporary security?</p>

<p>I hate writing posts about political matters. Maybe at some point the insanity will die down, and I can go back to writing about things that *don’t* make me mad for a change.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For those who use <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache 2.x</a>, this is a nice trick to keep people from hotlinking your images. I’ve seen a few variants of it, but this one I picked up most recently from a <a href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=197769&amp;cid=16205407">slashdot comment</a>, of all places.</p>

<p>Make sure you have enabled mod_rewrite, then add this in your <code>.htaccess</code> file for any directory with images in it:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class=""><span class="line"> RewriteEngine on
</span><span class="line"> RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^http://(www.)?yourdomain.com [NC]
</span><span class="line"> RewriteRule .* /files/goatse.jpg [NC,L]</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>
<p>to redirect to an awful image, or use my own personal variant:<br />
&lt;div class=&#8217;bogus-wrapper&#8217;&gt;<notextile><figure class="code">&lt;div class=&#8221;highlight&#8221;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#8221;gutter&#8221;&gt;&lt;pre class=&#8221;line-numbers&#8221;&gt;<span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
<span class="line-number">4</span>
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&#8217;code&#8217;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;<code class=""><span class="line"> RewriteEngine on
</span><span class="line"> RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^$
</span><span class="line"> RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^http://(www.)?sitename.com/.*$ [NC]
</span><span class="line"> RewriteRule .(gif|jpg|png)$ - [F]</span></code>&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</figure></notextile>&lt;/div&gt;
which doesn’t return <em>anything</em> if someone else hotlinks your images. If they like your images enough, they can like them enough to save a copy on their own webserver.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’ve been watching a great deal more television, reading a great deal more papers and “blogs”, and listening to a lot more interviews these days. And though it’s extremely hard to do this without politicizing what I see, I try to look at it as objectively as I can, from as many sources as I can.</p>

<p>I’m getting downright sick of this “War on Terror”. Not that global terrorism (as opposed to local terrorism?) isn’t an awful, awful thing, but that it has been a problem for years. I don’t think any American president for at least the last thirty or forty years has been exempt from having to deal with some sort of terrorism, whether pertaining directly to our citizens or to citizens of nations with which we have chosen to ally ourselves. I just have trouble lending credibility to the idea that we’re declaring war on “terror”. For some reason, it was shortened from “terrorism” to “terror” … I think I even vaguely remember when we declared a “war on terrorism”. The problem with this is the basic concept ; not only can you not declare war on a noun, but we’re not really fighting terror.</p>

<p>My good friend <a href="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/terror">Webster</a> defines terror as “to frighten”. I don’t think I have ever seen the people of my country as frightened as they are now. We were afraid to open our mail due to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_anthrax_attack">Anthrax</a> (which turned out to most likely be an American, not an “international terrorist”, but that’s completely irrelevant), afraid to fly because of the prospect of people <a href="http://www.september11news.com/">smashing planes into buildings</a>, afraid to <a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/resources/17343res20031114.html">keep our civil liberties</a>, and afraid to voice our opinions due to the prospect of being tainted as a coward, deserter, or someone who doesn’t love our country. You can’t fight terror by terrorizing the people you’re supposed to be protecting ; simple logic.</p>

<p>I love my country. I really do. I also believe that one of the highest forms of patriotism is being able to question your country and its leaders, to hold them accountable for their actions, whether or not you agree with them by political party lines. It would be nice if that weren’t vilified as unpatriotic, though.</p>

<p>While we’re talking about wars on nouns, how about the war on the English language? Referring back to <a href="http://www.m-w.com/definition/torture">Webster</a>, torture is defined as ” … inflicting agony … to punish or coerce (sic)”, yet I keep hearing pundits on a lot of mainstream media channels and “blogs” continue to try to make a distinction between torture and coersion, as if the intention behind an act alters the definition of the act itself. I’m more than a little upset that atrocities are carried out under the banner of protecting the liberties and freedoms of the people living in this country. Whether I support the *actual* wars that are being fought right now (the ones which don’t have an intangible object as the intended target) or not is irrelevant. I believe that we should be attempting to comport ourselves in a manner which appropriately reflects the greatness and respect of our country if we want others to respect it in the same way, in much the way that tourists represent the country from which they hail.</p>

<p>Please, stop trying to split hairs and redefine words. Don’t hide behind these words, but instead use your actions to convey something far greater: that you are a member of the greatest nation on earth, and that you respect everyone else’s right to have the same liberties that you brag about. What good is bringing freedom to the world if you can’t maintain your basic constitutional rights here?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was sitting by myself a few days ago, and started to wonder about the value of a single person. Not in relation to society, or anything else that tangible, but in relation to the totality of existence.</p>

<p>At first, I thought that the lack of a single person’s existence would irreperably alter the universe. Everything we do impacts others in thousands upon millions of imperceptible ways every day we’re alive, so wouldn’t one missing person somehow change the fabric of existence? Even stranger than that, wouldn’t that mean that everyone, no matter how insignificant they may seem at first glance, is special because they hold together what we consider to be reality?</p>

<p>Then I thought a bit further, and realized that a lot of the things we do cancel each other out, and thought that it didn’t seem possible that everyone could possibly hold the ability to alter reality and existence. It smacks of Chaos Theory (no matter how contested it is) to think that all of our contrary, opposing actions keep everything in balance and in check, so that the loss of a single person wouldn’t really make much difference in the grand scheme of the cosmos.</p>

<p>In reality, I think the answer is somewhere between the two. We can’t really aggrandize our lives and think that the universe would fall apart if we weren’t here, but I think that reality would change, and that pulling a single thread from a tapestry would eventually cause it to unravel or rearrange into something distinctly different. Maybe it’s not a reason for thinking that you have value or worth in the infinity of the universe, but it’s not as though you have to think that you have no effect on the universe either. As in everything else in life, this is best represented in shades of grey.</p>
