If you’ve got an old junky XBox around, and would like to put something, well, \*useful\* on it, like XBMC, then I’ve got a great link for you which allows soft modding without having a copy of any of the exploitable games.

[Patched xboxhdm 1.9 with exploits][1] will allow you to boot another PC while hotswapping your XBox hard drive into that machine. It has all of the known exploits on it, I believe, so you don’t have to have your XBox connected to another machine or anything, nice and simple. After that, use a fully automated installer like [Auto Installer Deluxe][2] to do everything else for you.

So, don’t throw that XBox out, make it into something much better.
