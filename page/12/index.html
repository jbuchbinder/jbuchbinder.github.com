  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, that’s it. At around 11pm EST, Senator John McCain conceded the presidency to Senator Barack Obama. All of my fears of stolen elections and bigotry prevailing were unfounded. And I owe someone a lunch, but gladly so.</p>

<p>After listening to a few pundits on TV and McCain’s concession speech, I have noticed that everyone keeps harping on Senator Obama’s race. I just find it difficult to believe that we’re so proud of our ability to not trip over our bigotry enough to elect someone who isn’t white. Get over yourselves. We’re supposed to be an *adult* nation, so try to act like one. Don’t boo the winner when you’ve been supporting the loser, even six year olds know better. I’m also amazed that every major news channel made this thing out to be a contest, when it was pretty much decided in the Democratic primary. I mean, I think the Republican brand is dogfood at this point… Strauss should be appropriately spinning in his grave.</p>

<p>On to energy independence and the end of warmongering, perhaps? Perhaps even some universal healthcare. But as Bill Cosby pointed out, it’s not enough for Senator Obama to be a decent president, he’s going to have to be far better and far greater, otherwise it would doom any other non-caucasian presidential hopefuls.</p>

<p>Now, if only I could get one of those sweet “O”-bama hats. I really want one, and now I can’t find one on his store …</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In case anyone was wondering, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/oct/17/executivesalaries-banking">we’ve been had</a>, in an awful, awful way, to the tune of around 70 *billion* dollars. And as pointed out on Cronytopia, <a href="http://chris-floyd.com/component/content/article/3/1631-cronytopia-what-the-world-knows-and-americans-dont-about-the-bailout.html">US newspapers aren’t covering it</a>.</p>

<p>Why aren’t we burning people in the streets, right now? I mean, I understand that the bailout passed by an overwhelming majority, but why were we so glad to give such a large amount of money to people that we shouldn’t trust raking manure, let alone running financial institutions?</p>

<p>Personally, I’m not giving a damn cent to investment bankers. They’ve scammed enough money away with the promise of “we’ll increase the amount of money you’ve got.” Screw the stock market. Let the well off people throw their money down that particular rat-hole. These people are off counting their money while our economy burns.</p>

<p>Can *anyone* please justify how we’re actually letting this happen? I can’t think of anyone apart from their MBA-holding compatriots in crime, who are anxiously hoping for some of that sweet, sweet socialized bailout money so they can also own a few chateaus… Fuck ‘em.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For all those fans of the venerable <a href="http://www.nslu2-linux.org/">NSLU2</a> (or “slug” as we like to call it), I have another package for OpenSlug/BE. This time it’s <a href="http://lpccomp.bc.ca/remserial/">remserial</a>, a Linux equivalent to the BSD “<a href="http://www.bsdua.org/netfwd.html">netfwd</a>” software, allowing serial ports to be redirected over TCP.</p>

<p>For those enterprising people who would like to use my <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?nmmwztgj5it">armv5b-softfloat-linux</a> cross compilation toolchain, I have made it available on <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/">mediafire</a> as well. It was compiled with Ubuntu 8.04.1 i386, so that’s the safest bet to use for compilation. I had used the NSLU2 “master makefile” to build it, since the vanilla crosstool had provided me little in terms of usable toolchains for the NSLU2.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>(Again, apologies to the people I stole the title from, the nice guys over at <a href="http://www.crooksandliars.com/">crooksandliars.com</a>.)</em></p>

<p>Every time I think I’ve heard the most awful thing done by religious people…</p>

<p>In the same day, I’ve heard two stories coming from the Catholic Church. Yes, I know, the guys who did the whole “inquisition” thing. But they’ve been keeping their noses clean since at least the 1950s, so I’ll start this off by pointing out that I don’t have any beef with the modern day Catholic Church. They don’t come knocking on my door like <a href="http://www.bible.ca/jw.htm">other pointless suit-festooned fuckers</a> or <a href="http://samuraimohel.wordpress.com/2008/03/26/messianic-jewish-hate-campaign-against-real-jews-in-full-swing/">pray for me to go to hell</a>, so we’re on pretty good terms.</p>

<p>But now I get to hear about a twelve time child molester priest, who, despite violating at least twelve children, is <a href="http://www.courant.com/news/local/statewire/hc-07070848.apds.m0962.bc-ct--prieoct07,0,4449400.story">still a damn priest</a>, is finally asked by *police* to come in to face charges. What the hell is wrong with the Church on this one? Isn’t shielding a child molester simply fueling accusations that all priests are kiddie-fuckers? I mean, come on, you’re seriously screwing up in the P.R. department on this one. If the guy were a school teacher and was caught with his jimmy in a fifth grader, I would think that he would never work again, and more than likely would have *awful* things happen to him in prison. This guy has been doing this stuff for *years* and just gets moved around. Must be nice to be in J.C.’s posse.</p>

<p>The second point is the <a href="http://www.courant.com/news/nationworld/wire/sns-ap-eu-vatican-pius-xii,0,7223261.story">whitewashing of Pope Pius XII</a> of any sort of culpability in the holocaust. He didn’t exactly hold open the doors of the gas chamber, but by most accounts he <a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/anti-semitism/pius.html">did absolutely nothing</a>. Now, I’m not sure exactly how far the criteria for becoming a Saint has fallen, but I’m sure letting people die isn’t exactly one of the prerequisites for it. I mean, <a href="http://www.americancatholic.org/Features/teresa/Sainthood.asp">Mother Teresa</a> has had a long road to it, after having spent many years tending to sick people. Pius let a total of <a href="http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h1677.html">between 10 and 26 million people die</a> during the Nazi’s reign — and he gets to be a Saint?</p>

<p>I know Ratzinger was in the <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article382076.ece">Official Hitler Fan Club</a>, but isn’t this a little much? His excuse for not having shot anyone as a Nazi Youth was an “infected finger.” Not that he didn’t want to, not that he objected, that he had a <em>bad finger</em>. At least <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_John_Paul_II">the last guy</a> actually improved things when he was pope, and in fact issued an apology for the exact thing that Ratzinger is trying to promote the sainthood for: <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/religion/jan-june98/vatican_4-8.html">doing jack squat during the holocaust</a>… and maybe a little <a href="http://www.fantompowa.net/Flame/the_vatican.htm">money laundering</a>. Who let this particular joker be pope, anyways?</p>

<p>I think the Vatican kinda needs to get its act together. I’d rather go back to laughing and pointing at stupid sex scandals and child molestation in <a href="http://www.watchtowerinformationservice.org/childabuse.htm">much lower hanging fruit</a> than having to see a 2000 year old institution made a laughing stock by poor leadership. Well, Ratzinger, ball’s in your court. Don’t make the Jewish guy on the cross cry any more than you have to.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently, you may have heard about certain <a href="http://tpmelectioncentral.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/09/obsession_dvd_distributors_wer.php">alarmist crap</a> being circulated in the guise of educational information to people in so called “swing states” in the upcoming 2008 election. Usually this crap doesn’t get an audience, but some of the kooks have been coming out of the woodwork, bitching at the top of their lungs about “islamic fundamentalism” and terrorist, and “oh! think of the children!”</p>

<p>Some people already think that the September 11, 2001 attacks were <a href="http://erlenda5.blogspot.com/">false flag</a> attacks, but regardless, it couldn’t have played better. We have a long and illustrious <a href="http://social.infowars.com/blog_entry.php?user=ericdubay&amp;blogentry_id=4945">history</a> of taking the stupid reaction to anything bad happening. Look as far back as the Revolutionary War or any of the conflicts with Native Americans. Demonize the other guys, we get to be the good guys, who can argue with that?</p>

<p>The United States could have cared less about World War II until the Pearl Harbor attack … and even then America wasn’t involved in WWII because of Nazi atrocities, but more because we wanted to kill Japanese people (and all of their colleagues), to “put right” the attack on Pearl Harbor.</p>

<p>Even before the end of WWII, we were already focused on the “new evil”, being Stalin’s USSR. For years, “communists” were “them” and “capitalists” were us, despite our habit of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_Chilean_coup_d'état">disposing democracies</a> in favor of dictatorships depending on their supposed strategic worth. The most important part of this was that most people hadn’t met a “communist”, but were willing to blame all of their problems on them, to the point of holding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCarthyism">witch trials</a>.</p>

<p>But the next generation of hatred started with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_hostage_crisis">Iranian hostage crisis</a>, when we decided that the guys in the middle east were a good target for us to hate. In the last ten years or so, guys like the <a href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Project_for_the_New_American_Century">PNAC</a> have been pushing for us to assert our American way over the supposed “savages”. Reminds you of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crusade">another time</a>, doesn’t it? Be afraid of the scary dark people, they’ll chop your heads off and blow up your buildings!</p>

<p>Of course, those don’t hold any more water than saying that the KKK is an accurate representation of Christianity, but it doesn’t even slow down the fearmongering. It’s just amazing that we’re all so xenophobic and hatefilled that we have to blame all of the world’s problems on a group of people we don’t understand very well. Economy sucks? Must be the blacks and the Muslims! Thinking of voting for something a little different for president? If you do, the blacks and the Muslims will get you! (We can always blame “the minorities” for everything, but we’re obviously not racist because we have at least one friend from that minority.)</p>

<p>This is the kind of thing that makes me <a href="http://james.lab6.com/2007/01/05/racism-and-nationalism-are-the-same-thing">hate Nationalism</a>, and <a href="http://www.adequacy.org/stories/2001.7.19.83250.1989.html">hate sports teams</a>. It’s all the same concept as racism, after all. Divide people up with artificial distinctions, and give yourself a reason to dislike people.</p>

<p>But it’s amazing how the herd instinct is so powerful in is that it keeps us from looking out for our own good. Look at the number of <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9a03e4d81639f93ba25752c0a9629c8b63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all">people who voted for Bush in 2004 because they were afraid</a> of terrorism. Mind you, people have been doing terrorist-like things here for years, but <a href="http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/notorious/mcveigh/dawning_1.html?print=yes">white Christian guys doing the same thing</a> apparently isn’t the same thing. Or maybe we can’t tell by his face that he isn’t one of “us”.</p>

<p>There are already a number of attempts to <a href="http://rawstory.com/news/2008/For_campaigns_now_its_personal_1006.html">equate one of the Presidential candidates with terrorism</a> (them). It’s crap, of course, since all of the attacks have been <a href="http://216.87.173.33/media/2008/0810/msnbc_ko_comment_palin_terrorists_081006a.flv">debunked ad nauseum</a>, but when has that ever stopped “us” from going after “them”? I would have been more upset with the other guy talking about <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jared-bernstein/the-most-important-piece_b_101237.html">the death of social services</a>, since that affects people, but what do I know? People actually living with the assistance of social programs still vote Republican — I have no idea why, but they do.</p>

<p>The thing I worry about is that <a href="http://library.thinkquest.org/C004367/eh4.shtml">social darwinism</a> is a crock of crap, as is pure capitalism. But we’re operating on the idea that the possible worst case scenarios, “welfare queens” (which is code for “black”, even though no one really wants to use that word) are a fringe, not the majority, but somehow that has eeked its way into the public consciousness. Why should we, as honest hard-working Americans, pay to support other people? Because we’re going to be paying for some sort of programs, and I guess its up to us whether we’re paying for Wall Street execs or people who actually *need* the money. Or war, we can spend it on war…</p>

<p>Please, everyone, don’t vote with a herd mentality. It hurts my head to think that people are that petty and stupid.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Before a friend clued me in to the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/embeddedgmetric/">embedded gmetric</a> project, I had needed to strip out just the gmetric binary for use in monitoring a process on the NSLU2 I was using.</p>

<p>So, for anyone who is interested, I have posted both a <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/file/ixjnx2sjwue/gmetric_3.1.1_1.armv5teb.ipk">binary ipkg package</a> for OpenSLUG/BE and a <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/file/wdnlyyyr6wi/gmetric-src-3.1.1.tar.bz2">source package</a> containing all of the pieces I yanked from the ganglia 3.1.1 distribution to create it. (Graciously hosted by <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/">mediafire.com</a>…) Hopefully this can be of use to someone.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There have been a number of truly awful and stupid things going on in the world, but I think I’m going to pick on a very particular piece of stupid.</p>

<p>In case it was overshadowed by other, larger economic news, we just <a href="http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12341970">bailed out GM, Ford and Chrysler to the tune of 25 *billion* dollars</a>. I’d like to believe that it’s all due to horrible economic conditions — but I’m starting to think it might have a bit more to due with <a href="http://knowledge.emory.edu/article.cfm?articleid=1148">having their heads up their asses</a>. We love putting out big, pointless gas guzzling crapboxes like the <a href="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1374/is_/ai_57800251">Excursion</a>, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Business/story?id=3326593">Humvee</a>, and the <a href="http://mygasguzzler.com/">Navigator</a>.</p>

<p>Then I catch a television commericial from <a href="http://caddyinfo.com/wordpress/?p=436">Cadillac</a> regarding a hybrid version of their fuel sucking Escalade line. Small print indicates that it gets less than 14 MPG… but the real kick in the nuggets comes from GM’s site on it … <a href="http://www.gmfleet.com/pages/submodelOverview/2009_Cadillac_Escalade Hybrid_Hybrid.jsp">is that it costs at least $71,000</a>.</p>

<p>I should start by saying that <em>no one</em> needs one of those. It’s a serious “check out my shiny silver-rimmed penis” thing, and that particular mentality is a great deal of why we have no damn public transportation industry, and indeed why we bend over for at least 10% of our paychecks to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia">fund some pretty awful people</a> halfway around the world.</p>

<p>My question to the auto industy is this: are you fucking kidding me? You know we’re in an awful economic climate where new car sales are down because no one has any credit nor cash on hand to buy these overpriced turkeys outright, and you insist on created expensive luxury vehicles which shore up our gas prices (basic supply and demand going on here, no PhD required) and then tack on the word “hybrid” so the rich fuckers who can buy these things can go back to <a href="http://www.southparkstuff.com/season_10/episode_1002/epi1002script/">sniffing their own farts</a> and pretending that they’re doing something positive in the world?</p>

<p>Hybrids are, by design, a horrible kludge to keep us all using gasoline, even if it’s only to a lesser degree, because Americans don’t want to transition away from their shiny metal wangs. I mean, we kinda <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_American_Streetcar_Scandal">killed our train lines</a>, and have a really sorry excuse for busses and shuttles in all but our most populated areas. Europe has been trying to transition to solar and geothermal power with some distributed charging stations ; still avoiding the issue of people still thinking that everyone needs a car, but at least not requiring petrol.</p>

<p>We’re <a href="http://dsc.discovery.com/convergence/addictedtooil/addictedtooil.html">addicted to oil</a>, and until <a href="http://www.gm.com/">shitheads</a> start thinking about things other than trying to juice people for more money for large, pointless vehicles, we’re kinda stuck with this stuff. Let’s hope <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercapacitor">super capacitor</a> technology picks up, and maybe we we’ll see long range EVs for less than 20k$.</p>
