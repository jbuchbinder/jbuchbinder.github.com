![][2]

The Eighth Floor – The name may sound strange, but the music is rocking; listen below for samples.

![][3]

Jake Bachand – Started working on a full-length studio project. A talented guitar player and songwriter, and all-around good guy. Past projects include *Maranatha*, *evoke*, and *Earthset*.

![][4]

Natasha Darius – Beautiful voice, great lyrics, and something \*definitely\* worth listening to.

![][5]

[Justin Fox][6] – Working on the audiobook for his original novel series “*The Chronicles of Centack*“. 
[Click for a short sample.][7]   ![][8]

[Blaney Brothers][9]. Very talented duo — and yes, they are actually brothers. 
One of their originals is [Cold Dark Places][10].    


The samples provided here are low-quality Ogg Vorbis files. Codecs and players to listen to these files are available below if your computer does not already play these files. (Ogg Vorbis files are similar to the more popular MP3 file format, but they provide higher quality with smaller file sizes.)
