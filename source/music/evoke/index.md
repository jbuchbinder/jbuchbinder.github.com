The band I’ve played in since 2000, bass and backing vocals.

Obligatory blurb:

**evoke** is a Connecticut based band consisting of hard rock guitars, funk style bass, and kick-ass drums. The band released an EP (self-titled) and a full-length LP (unofficially titled “Pushing the Envelope”), as well as a live CD of a show at the Webster Theatre in Hartford, Connecticut. They toured most of New England, playing in every type of venue imaginable. Tracks from **evoke**’s first EP were reviewed on garageband.com, and “Hyperventalike” was chosen as a “Track of the Day” for Hard Rock.

**evoke** also recently was one of four bands nationwide to win the 2007 Ernie Ball Battle of the Bands online competition.
