This is a list of things that I’d like to have at some point or other, split up into categories. If you want to get me something, chances are that getting me something on this list will result in a greater chance of me liking it.

## Sound/Recording

*   [AKG Perception 220](http://www.zzounds.com/item--AKGPERCEPTION220) or [AKG Perception 420](http://www.zzounds.com/item--AKGPERCEPTION420) condenser microphone
*   [ART DPS II](http://www.zzounds.com/item--ARTDPSII) digital compressor

*   <del>[12′ TOSLINK cable](http://www.geekbro.com/index.cfm/hurl/page=product/itemid=699467?source=GoogleBase)</del> – Found these at Ocean State Job Lot for 3$ a piece.
*   [Carvin CTM100](http://www.carvinguitars.com/products/CTM100): Someone had brought this model mic into the studio with them, and it seems to be versatile enough that I should be getting one.

## Computer/Gadget Related

*   <del>[Linksys WRT54GL](http://amzn.to/1dZ1mnf)</del> – Replacement wireless router for the one I’ve burned out. Needs to be the “L” model, otherwise it won’t work for me. Got my present router working for me.
