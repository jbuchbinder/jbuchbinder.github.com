    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Terry Gilliam is, in my opinion, one of the great distinctive film directors of the latter part of the 20th century. Books have been written – literally – about his techniques and his rather unique style of filmmaking. I’m going to focus on one of my favorite films of his, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096764/">The Adventures of Baron Munchausen</a>, to study Gilliam’s artful reveal shots.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>A <em>reveal shot</em> is a shot where one or more visual element(s) are revealed to the viewer through either camera movement, movement in the mise-en-scène, or a combination of the two; the element(s) usually have some sort of significant relevance to the overall plot, as the reveal shot is usually regarded as a fairly powerful shot in a filmmaker’s arsenal.</p>

<p><em>Munchausen</em> is a <a href="/2015/03/08/layers/">layered film</a>, and Gilliam transitions between the different layers of story and relative reality in relatively unusual ways, which I posit is to maintain the tenuous separation between these layers.</p>

<p>One of my favorite reveal shots in the film comes in the first act on a <em>literal</em> stage. The Baron has decided to elucidate what he considers to be the “real” version of events involving himself, as he stands in the narrator’s position on the stage as the curtain is lifted to reveal a set of the Sultan’s Palace, with all the lack-of-depth that such a stage set would afford:</p>

<p><img src="/images/2015/03/munchausen-reveal-A-01.jpg" alt="A-01" /></p>

<p>As he begins to narrate, “The Grand Turk” (the Sultan) – or at least, the actor <em>playing</em> the Sultan in the Salts’ stage production – is pushed out to center stage, as if to prepare to play out the action being narrated by the Baron.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2015/03/munchausen-reveal-A-02.jpg" alt="A-02" /></p>

<p>Gilliam flips back to The Baron so that he can tell a (relatively) personal anecdote about being granted access to the Sultan’s harem.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2015/03/munchausen-reveal-A-03.jpg" alt="A-03" /></p>

<p>We then flip to a side view – what we can only assume is, more or less, a POV shot from The Baron’s point of view. We see the stage hands and the rest of the cast, urging the actor playing the Sultan to move forward.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2015/03/munchausen-reveal-A-04.jpg" alt="A-04" /></p>

<p>He then begins to move forward. Notice that, right now, we’re completely in the theater, and this character is the <em>actor</em> <strong>playing</strong> the Sultan.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2015/03/munchausen-reveal-A-05.jpg" alt="A-05" /></p>

<p>We move forward a few frames, and we see that, rather than the front of the stage, we’re now seeing something that <em>wasn’t there</em> in the previous shots – guards. This is the image where he crosses what <em>should</em> be the threshold of the stage. To the left is the world of the theatre, to the right is … the palace.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2015/03/munchausen-reveal-A-06.jpg" alt="A-06" /></p>

<p>Forward another second or so, and he has completely left the theater, and the character we see in front of us is no longer the <em>actor</em> playing the Sultan, but now <em>is</em> the Sultan.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2015/03/munchausen-reveal-A-07.jpg" alt="A-07" /></p>

<p>Without any cutting during the transition, Gilliam has managed to transport us from one reality to another ; from one layer of film to another nested one. This didn’t require any special effects or camera tricks, but simply duplicating a small piece of the theater set (with lighting) adjacent to the edge of the palace set, allowing the juxtaposition of the two realities in a single seamless shot.</p>

<p>Another stylized reveal comes by way of a repeated shot, as part of three – more minor – reveal shots. When The Baron wins the wager with the Sultan, he’s told that he can have as much gold as “the strongest man can carry”. The treasurer opens a comically sized lock …</p>

<p><img src="/images/2015/03/munchausen-reveal-B-01.jpg" alt="B-01" /></p>

<p>… to reveal what appears to be a few gold coins.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2015/03/munchausen-reveal-B-02.jpg" alt="B-02" /></p>

<p>But which when we pull back …</p>

<p><img src="/images/2015/03/munchausen-reveal-B-03.jpg" alt="B-03" /></p>

<p>… reveals a ridiculous pile of gold and treasure. The next shot shows a pile of treasure with a ladder.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2015/03/munchausen-reveal-B-04.jpg" alt="B-04" /></p>

<p>We crane down…</p>

<p><img src="/images/2015/03/munchausen-reveal-B-05.jpg" alt="B-05" /></p>

<p>… to reveal Albrecht holding everything on his shoulders.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2015/03/munchausen-reveal-B-06.jpg" alt="B-06" /></p>

<p>Cut to the Baron, looking very smug. Note that this is the <em>same shot</em> used to show the subjective story about the Sultan’s harem from my earlier example, with the Baron appearing in roughly the same framing, but slightly more to the center of the frame. The Baron is front and center in this reality, as opposed to the off-kilter nature of the “real” world of the theater.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2015/03/munchausen-reveal-B-07.jpg" alt="B-07" /></p>

<p>Then we repeat the earlier dolly-back shot to reveal exactly what the Baron and his minions have done with the Sultan’s treasure:</p>

<p><img src="/images/2015/03/munchausen-reveal-B-08.jpg" alt="B-08" /></p>

<p><img src="/images/2015/03/munchausen-reveal-B-09.jpg" alt="B-09" /></p>

<p>The framing and composition are the same, with the exception of Albrecht moving the treasure, which had been in the foreground in the previous shot, out of the comically small exit, and beating a hasty retreat.</p>

<p><em>In the interests of brevity, I’m breaking this post up into multiple parts, so that I can demonstrate more examples of the full range of reveal shots used by Gilliam in this film.</em></p>

    <link href="http://jbuchbinder.com/2015/03/21/house-of-cards-chapter-30-shot-reverse-shot/"/>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is a deconstruction of a single scene in Netflix’s <em>House of Cards</em>, from the <a href="http://house-of-cards.wikia.com/wiki/Chapter_30">fourth episode of the third season</a>.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>One of the most common conversational constructions in modern film and television is <em>shot / reverse shot</em>. It’s the usual way (using an approach forwarded by <a href="http://www.openculture.com/2014/11/a-visual-introduction-to-soviet-montage-theory-a-revolution-in-filmmaking.html">Soviet montage theory</a>) to show a conversation between two people by cutting between single shots of each person to establish that a conversation is taking place. Sometimes this is done with choker or half shots with a single character in frame, sometimes this is done with “over the shoulder” shots, where the other character appears in frame – though usually out of focus or not in the principal focal part of the frame.</p>

<p>Another, competing approach, is to reframe the shot to include characters, incorporating fewer cuts. Older cinema, such as Kurosawa’s <em>The Bad Sleep Well</em>, used this system for conveying conversation:</p>

<p><div class="embed-video-container"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/jGc-K7giqKM "></iframe></div></p>

<p>As this more holistic approach to film exposition and exposing conversation has fallen by the wayside, we have seen a drop in <a href="http://www.cinemetrics.lv/database.php">average shot length</a>. <em>The Bad Sleep Well</em> has an ASL of 15.9 seconds, but <em>The Avengers</em> has an ASL of somewhere between 2.8 and 5 seconds (depending on who measured it). <em>Breaking Bad</em>’s pilot episode had an ASL of 5.5 seconds, according to the same database, so we can see that the decrease in shot length is not limited to film.</p>

<p><em>Chapter 30</em> provides a good example of a well composed and executed shot / reverse shot, performed in a moderately unconventional style, in the hallway conversation between Heather Dunbar and Doug Stamper. The scene also has some trappings of classic horror and suspense film.</p>

<p>It starts when Dunbar receives a call from Stamper. She is still flanked by colleagues, but visually separated, as she is isolated by the narrow depth-of-field in the shot. Lighting on her face is good, and we can see that she’s supposed to be a relatively good person; at least, in the <em>House of Cards</em> pantheon of Gods and Demi-gods.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2015/03/hoc-304-001.jpg" alt="001" /></p>

<p>As she looks down the hall, we’re treated to what must obviously be Dunbar’s point of view, with Stamper occupying a very small space in the frame – a shadow at the end of a hall. We’re immediately aware of the separation between the two, which includes not only their physical distance, but the professional separation between the two. Stamper could have simply come up to her, but as he says, “Stay where you are. We wouldn’t want to be seen together.”</p>

<p><img src="/images/2015/03/hoc-304-002.jpg" alt="002" /></p>

<p>As Dunbar commits to the conversation, she moves into the center of the frame, and her colleagues are gone. She’s all alone, and we’re very aware that she is the most important thing in this conversation. The man in the shadows does not (yet) have any critical importance to her.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2015/03/hoc-304-003.jpg" alt="003" /></p>

<p>The conversation continues, and we finally get a closer shot of Stamper; but he’s still mostly obscured by the shadows, finally occupying a larger part of the frame as his position becomes more important to Dunbar. He’s talking about how he’s been “out of the game” (on the <em>sidelines</em>) as he’s physically away from the center of the frame.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2015/03/hoc-304-004.jpg" alt="004" /></p>

<p>The perspective is flipped, mid conversation, to show Stamper’s point of view. We can see that Dunbar is isolated, but of prime importance, occupying the center portion of the frame with all lines leading directly to her. It’s also fairly impersonal, as we can’t see her face.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2015/03/hoc-304-005.jpg" alt="005" /></p>

<p>The monster (Stamper) approaches. His features are still mostly obscured, which is part of some of the horror/thriller idiom. (I actually left out a floor level shot of his feet, which also speaks to that.) We know that this is <em>not</em> a good person, even if we haven’t seen the previous seasons of <em>House of Cards</em>. He’s quite <em>literally</em> blocking the light and bringing darkness wherever he goes. As he draws closer, the reverse shot of her draws in.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2015/03/hoc-304-006.jpg" alt="006" /></p>

<p>As he comes close to Dunbar, it should be noted that we never see their faces in the same shot. Continuing with the theme of darkness vs light, we see Stamper pass Dunbar in the hallway obscuring the frame, first from the left …</p>

<p><img src="/images/2015/03/hoc-304-007.jpg" alt="007" /></p>

<p>… then completely obscuring Dunbar in darkness.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2015/03/hoc-304-008.jpg" alt="008" /></p>

<p>When she finally emerges from his shadow, we see that the are represented as equals in frame size and position. He passes just as he mentions that they both “rub shoulders” with different people ; her with the leadership, he with those who work for them.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2015/03/hoc-304-009.jpg" alt="009" /></p>

<p>At the end of the conversation, Stamper recedes into the background, losing immediate importance to the conversation, while our shot of Dunbar is only slightly wider than our original framing of her:</p>

<p><img src="/images/2015/03/hoc-304-010.jpg" alt="010" /></p>

<p>Finally, Stamper gets into the elevator as a mechanical voice announces “Going down.” This seems to be a not-so-subtle inference about Stamper’s less-than-pure intentions, as well as a reference to the good/evil theme which we see in other parts of this episode.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2015/03/hoc-304-011.jpg" alt="011" /></p>

<p>I might end up putting together a deconstruction on some of the other parts of this episode, but this scene is a good example of shot / reverse shot used in an effective, yet slightly unconventional, way.</p>

    <link href="http://jbuchbinder.com/2015/03/08/layers/"/>
    <updated>2015-03-08T18:09:24-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://jbuchbinder.com/2015/03/08/layers</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote>
  <p>Life’s but a walking shadow, a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage, and then is heard no more. It is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. - <em>Macbeth</em>, Shakespeare</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We’ve become accustomed to viewing film, whether consciously or subconsciously, as a separate world with its own <a href="/2015/02/26/film-epistemology/">intrinsic epistemology</a>. It represents a false world constructed within our own world – much like a play or other piece of narrative fiction.</p>

<p>Certain films exhibit a layering of realities – a “film within a film”, or “mise en abyme” – which can be used as a powerful narrative tool or as a metaphor for some larger concept. By interweaving stories within stories, a more complex tale can emerge which can be more intricate than the stories would be if told separately.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="stories-within-stories-flashbacks-and-narration">Stories within Stories: Flashbacks and Narration</h2>

<p>Layered stories don’t have to represent a separate reality or epistemology ; they can also be used as an expository tool. In Zemeckis’ <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109830/">Forrest Gump</a>, the vast majority of the story is told as a series of flashbacks – which we can view as being self-contained short films, even though they exist within the epistemological domain of the film. We believe the stories that we are being told are objective reality, even through the denouement, because we are given no reason to doubt the sincerity and authenticity of our venerable narrator at any point during the film.</p>

<p>The concept of “narrator as liar”, which I have explored, along with the layered story concept, in my original piece on <a href="/2015/02/26/film-epistemology/">film epistemology</a>, shows that the concept of a sincere and authentic narrator can be subverted to use flashback sequences and narration as both a narrative tool <em>and</em> a plot device. The examples I had given included Verbal Kint in Singer’s <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114814/">The Usual Suspects</a> and the narrator in Fincher’s <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137523/">Fight Club</a>.</p>

<p>There is an additional aspect, along with a component of ambiguity present in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0144084/">American Psycho</a>, in that that Bateman’s “inner story” continues with the “narrator as liar” concept during the natural time-flow of the film, without resorting to flashback sequences to tell the ambiguous portions of the story. It should be noted that, while there are non-temporal flow portions of the story told through flashbacks, they are not a majority of the device used to tell the story. We’re treated to the ambiguity of a narrator who <em>doesn’t know that he is a liar</em>, much like the narrator in <em>Fight Club</em> – but <em>Fight Club</em> is told, almost entirely, as a series of flashback sequences.</p>

<p>Putting aside “narrator as liar” examples, however, shows that many Hollywood films rely heavily on flashback-style authentic exposition to tell their stories within their epistemological system; so much that we don’t view those flashbacks as a potentially separate epistemological system or inner story, but as an adjunct to the primary story. In this way, we are told stories within stories without them actually <em>being</em> a logically separate story.</p>

<h2 id="stories-within-stories-stages-films-and-an-inner-story">Stories within Stories: Stages, Films, and an Inner Story</h2>

<p>Inner stories can be represented by actual film, theater, or book productions or materials. In this way, the inner story can be physically separated from the outer story – even if some ambiguity is potentially introduced in the story about that separation.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/stills/sherlockjr11.jpg" width="300" height="200" title="‘Keaton inhabiting the inner story in “Sherlock Jr”’" ></p>

<p>Keaton’s <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0015324/">Sherlock Jr</a> tells the majority of the narrative through the dream of the protagonist, who works as a film projectionist. This, by itself, isn’t anything special, but Keaton’s character walks through film audience present in the outer story, who are implicitly watching the inner story, and physically injects himself into the film by walking through the invisible “fourth wall” to be come a part of the inner story.</p>

<p>Weir’s <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120382/">The Truman Show</a> treats us to an unwitting participant in a television show, in what appears to be an allegory about man’s relationship to his creator as he discovers the true nature of his existence. Where it was a bit heavy-handed in some places (Harris’s character being named “Christof”, or the line “I am the creator … (pregnant pause) … of a television show”), the “real world” and outer story exist outside of the inner story while the denizens of the outer story are shown voyeuristically watching the predominant inner story as it slowly is shown to recede into the outer story as the metaphoric curtain is pulled back. Our protagonist <em>literally</em> bows before leaving the not-so-metaphoric stage, giving us a curtain call for the inner story moments before the outer story ends. There is also a certain implication that Truman is experiencing a widening of his perceptions and metaphorically (as well as physically) escaping the epistemological confinement in which he lived his entire life – quite possibly a not-so-subtle poke at religion.</p>

<p>I refer back to one of my favorite Gilliam films, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096764/">The Adventures of Baron Munchausen</a> for an example of an inner theatre-stage-set story, as well as to Iñárritu’s now critically-acclaimed <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2562232/">Birdman</a>. Both have an inner theater production which relates (to one degree or another) to the outer story. I’m not going to even <em>attempt</em> to do a better <a href="http://www.avclub.com/article/how-reality-becomes-function-film-technique-birdma-215503">technical analysis of the film</a> than SEK did, but I would like to note that both the inner stage play and the meta-discussion in the outer story regarding that inner play relate back to the outer plot and outer reality, even as the protagonist appears to be losing his grip on it. Theater has been used in other popular films, more recently <em>Moulin Rouge</em> and both versions of <em>To Be or Not To Be</em>, although it does not inherently contain the same implications about the nature of reality that <em>Munchausen</em> does; the concept of mise en abysme is, instead, used as a simple narrative device to drive the story forward.</p>

<p>As for a literature-based inner story, Goldman and Reiner’s <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093779/">The Princess Bride</a> qualifies as an example of an inner story told as an outer story narrator relating the contents of an outer story work of fiction containing the inner story. A far more nuanced example of this would be Kaufmann and Jonze’s <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0268126/">Adaptation</a> because it defies that simple categorization. Even though Hollywood films’ authors have become increasingly self-referential – possibly due to the old adage about writing “what you know” (which is, appropriately, lampshaded in <em>Adaptation</em> through Brian Cox’s character) – most of the stories are banal tales of narcissism and self indulgence, as the author almost invariably makes him or herself the infallible protagonist.</p>

<h2 id="ambiguity-between-inner-and-outer-story">Ambiguity Between Inner and Outer Story</h2>

<p>In <em>Adaptation</em>, Kaufmann’s inner story starts by intentionally confusing the real world with the outer story. This trend continues throughout the course of the film, and was so successful at confusing the intended epistemology that a <em>fictional character</em>, Kaufmann’s twin brother, received a joint writing award for the screenplay for <em>Adaptation</em>. He also creates an inner story as the screenplay adaptation for “The Orchid Thief” – which is a <em>real</em> book in our reality, and which serves as the <em>real world</em> source for the story material in <em>Adaptation</em>. The outer story is an adaptation of “The Orchid Thief”, but so is the inner story. It is a masterpiece of both ambiguous epistemic domains and an interesting viewpoint regarding the entire craft behind film adaptations.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Well, I really want to encourage a kind of fantasy, a kind of magic. I love the term magic realism, whoever invented it — I do actually like it because it says certain things. It’s about expanding how you see the world. I think we live in an age where we’re just hammered, hammered to think this is what the world is. Television’s saying, everything’s saying “That’s the world.” And it’s not the world. The world is a million possible things. - Terry Gilliam, <a href="http://www.believermag.com/issues/200303/?read=interview_gilliam">Salman Rushdie talks with Terry Gilliam</a> <sup>(<a href="http://www.webcitation.org/6WsvDrr34">cite</a>)</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would be doing any readers of this piece a serious disservice by failing to mention Terry Gilliam’s works in a piece regarding inner and outer story ambiguities. Most of his films have some sort of delusion, story, or narrative work which tries to transcend the barrier between imagination and reality – of inner story and outer story.</p>

<p><em>Munchausen</em> delivers this ambiguity through both filmmaking techniques, such as cross-cutting quickly between two conflicting layers of story (the bombing of the theater contrasted with the escape from the Sultan’s palace) or mixing sets in such a way to deliberately fuse the stories together (when the actor playing the Sultan is pushed out onto the stage for the reveal that he is now in the Sultan’s palace). The battle between imagination and reality is given a physical form, as well, through the characters of The Right Ordinary Horatio Jackson (Jonathan Pryce) and the Baron himself. In one of the inner stories, Jackson assassinates the Baron as he is being accepted and lauded by a world which had rejected him – but it is shown to be an inner story, and the Baron (imagination) is still able to outlive and outwit Jackson (reality).</p>

<p>A similar, yet different, scenario is set up in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114746/">Twelve Monkeys</a>. Cole has a recurring dream about seeing a man shot before he returns to the past – but is the “past” really the present, and his “present” (our future) really just a delusion? Gilliam spends a good portion of the film playing up the ambiguity of those two states against Cole’s fragile mental state. We’re given <em>some</em> sort of epistemic relief when Dr Railly finds pictures of Cole in a history book and identifies a bullet as being very old – but there’s never really any certainty, and the ambiguity can theoretically continue on. Cole’s “dream” is revealed in the final act to be his unknowing memory of his own death, completing his timeline in an out-of-sequence circle. Even though Cole is warned that he will be lost to the past (assuming that his “present” is actually reality) and told that history is immutable, he still tries to change it. We are all puppets in the grand scheme of history – from an anthropological point of view, this has already happened – but Cole can’t accept that he is not the master of his own destiny.</p>

<p>Another example of ambiguity between outer and inner story / film is Brooks’ <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071230/">Blazing Saddles</a>. Not only do the characters seem to be periodically aware that they are part of the outer film, occasionally using frontality to speak directly to the audience a la Groucho Marx, but the outer film <em>is</em> the inner film. Much as he did in <em>Spaceballs</em>, Brooks conflates the inner and outer films while making it clear that the characters are somewhat aware that they exist within a film. <em>Spaceballs</em> does this through both dialogue (“The ship’s too big; if I walk, the movie’ll be over.”) and through entire scenes (the “instant cassettes” scene). Although this is primarily played for laughs, it intrinsically changes our perceptions of the characters through our knowledge of their self-aware nature. <em>Blazing Saddles</em> not only juxtaposes the ending fight scene in Rock Ridge with the characters <em>literally</em> breaking the fourth wall into other sets, but has the characters simultaneously watching their film while other characters are, according to the in-universe continuity, still making that film. Continuity even carries over between the two layers, with Wilder holding his theater popcorn bucket in the scene after he is shown to be in a theater … watching the very film that he has yet to finish.</p>

<p>The last example I’d like to cite is the excellent <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0352520/">The Life and Death of Peter Sellers</a>. It follows an interwoven narrative, given with subjective exposition by the titular character, played expertly by the always-superb Geoffrey Rush. The story within story motif is clear as Sellers is shown intermittently to be playing <em>every character</em> whenever the thin curtain between the outer and inner material is pulled back. The titular character is so egotistical and full of himself that we are constantly reminded that we are seeing the world through <em>his</em> subjective gaze. We have to assume that what we are seeing somewhat resembles the objective truth, even though our narrator is a self-proclaimed liar, to one degree or another. Apart from Rush playing Sellers playing his characters as a function of narcissism, it functions as a film technique to point to Sellers’ lack of a solid sense of self or personality – much as the discontinuous editing technique of <em>Deconstructing Harry</em> points to the fractured way that its eponymous character views reality.</p>

<h2 id="reality-as-a-shared-delusion">Reality as a Shared Delusion</h2>

<p>Even though the Wachowskis’ <em>The Matrix</em> popularized this in film culture, the idea that reality as we know it is just a shared delusion has been around for a while. John Carpenter’s <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096256/">They Live</a> insinuated, more than ten years before <em>The Matrix</em>, that most people live in a shared delusion, unable to see the reality that exists around them. The inner story and the outer story share not only diagetic space, but also epistemological space. They live in the same world, even if the shared delusion of some make it appear to be a different world. The campy pastiche film <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086856/">The Adventures of Buckaroo Bonzai Across the 8th Dimension</a> (which predated <em>They Live</em> by four years) uses a similar separation between inner and outer story. It does use a different differentiation mechanism: a spark of energy rather than a pair of sunglasses.</p>

<p><em>The Matrix</em> physically separated the denizens of the shared delusion by embedding the inner story in the container of a computer simulation, which the outer story characters, once aware, could jump in and out of. It played very heavily off of the concept of awareness, in that some people in the inner story could jump to the outer story by having knowledge that they were essentially characters in a fiction. There are a lot of philosophical overtones present, and I’m sure others have done far more justice to analyzing them than I would have done.</p>

<p>Proyas’s <em>Dark City</em> is an interesting hybrid between the type of shared delusions in <em>They Live</em> and <em>The Matrix</em>. Like <em>They Live</em>, the characters experiencing the shared delusion of the inner story share the same space as the characters experiencing the outer story, and much like <em>The Matrix</em>, they are unwitting test subjects, whose gruesome reality is not apparent to them until they are willing to take a leap of faith, of sorts (the red pill/blue pill test in <em>The Matrix</em> and trying to find Shell Beach in <em>Dark City</em>). In <em>Dark City</em>, no one questions why there is never any sun, nor why they never have any desire to leave the city, nor why they only have dim, distant memories; they accept the reality with which they are presented.</p>

<p>Nolan’s <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/">Inception</a> not only has a inner story, but <em>three more</em> story layers beneath. One of the criticisms I’ve heard about <em>Inception</em> was that, due to the varying story layers, it was difficult to follow; I didn’t agree with that assessment, but felt compelled to include it here. Depending on whether or not you agree that the “real world” shown as the outer story layer is, indeed, the outer story layer or not, there may be an unseen layer between the further visible story layer and our reality. To further complicate matters, the characters are all meant to represent different functions of filmmakers – there is a “meta-meaning” on top of the already convoluted layered-reality story line. One of the most important epistemological constants in all of the realities is that the inhabitants of any of these stories are, much like the characters in most films, unaware that they are living in a story, or a story within a story, or a story within a story within …</p>

<p>Much like <em>Dark City</em>’s theme of the Strangers trying to steal our souls / humanity through our memories, Jeunet’s <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112682/">La cité des enfants perdus</a> centers around the theme of a mad scientist, Krank, trying to take youth / life from children by stealing their dreams. The film is rife with shared delusions and obsessions, from the clones’ attempt to prove which is “l’originale”, to Krank’s obsession with living through the dreams of others, to One’s need for family to live out his dystopian existence.</p>

<h2 id="why-does-this-technique-resonate-with-us">Why does this technique resonate with us?</h2>

<p>I don’t think I can put forth a concrete answer to that, mostly due to the way that eisegesis trumps exegesis in the majority of film viewers.</p>

<p>My working theory is that layered stories resonate because they tap into some subconscious desire for us to see this world as as dream – or at the very least, a part of a bigger, better world. To quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There’s an old joke - um… two elderly women are at a Catskill mountain resort, and one of ‘em says, “Boy, the food at this place is really terrible.” The other one says, “Yeah, I know; and such small portions.” Well, that’s essentially how I feel about life - full of loneliness, and misery, and suffering, and unhappiness, and it’s all over much too quickly.” - <em>Annie Hall</em>, Woody Allen</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This desire for more – of something – generally is accompanied with the idea that the something we seek is <em>better</em> than what we have here and now. Film is, to one extent or another, escapism. It could be argued that one of the pushes for epistemic closure in film stems from our desire not to let the comforting delusion of the film universe, which we love, abruptly end with a credit roll.</p>

<p>There are some films where the story breaks out of an inner world into an outer one, and the outer world is far more horrifying and bleak than the inner world. This subverts our desires for a better outer world, as exploited masterfully in Proyas’s <em>Dark City</em> and the Wachowskis’ <em>The Matrix</em>. It is also implied in <em>The Truman Show</em> that the outer world is a terrible place, by Christof.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>This continues the analysis from my <a href="/2015/02/26/film-epistemology/">previous article on epistemology in film</a>. It makes more sense in the context of the first part.</em></p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="known-unknowns-and-unknown-unknowns">Known unknowns and unknown unknowns</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns – the ones we don’t know we don’t know. And if one looks throughout the history of our country and other free countries, it is the latter category that tend to be the difficult ones. - Donald Rumsfeld</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m not a big fan of Donald Rumsfeld, but his attempt to weasel out of a bad PR situation by echoing the sentiments of Nassim Taleb’s “Fooled by Randomness” does have a silver lining of real value in epistemological evaluation – as well as in the analysis of the effects of intentionally incomplete epistemology on film viewing.</p>

<p>There are certain things that are going to fall outside the realm of narrative exposition – our “unknown unknowns”. These can manifest as plot twists, or may simply contain areas of knowledge which are tangential, to a certain degree, to our principal characters or plot.</p>

<p>The “known unknowns” are the principal fodder for epistemic expansion. For example, in the context of Nolan’s <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468569/">The Dark Knight</a>, we are treated to a series of false-lead backstories for the Joker, but we’re always aware that we have <em>no idea</em> where he comes from, or anything outside of the explicitly available information in the film epistemology.</p>

<p>The oddest quadrant of the known/unknown delineation is the “unknown known”. In the system of information that we <em>don’t know that we know</em>, there are plenty of subtle hints and pieces of subliminal information which we ingest during the course of viewing the first acts of a film before the potential payoff in the last act. We may not be conscious that we know these things until they are brought to our attention, and the information moves to become a “known known”.</p>

<h2 id="epistemology-as-part-of-a-larger-canon">Epistemology as part of a larger canon</h2>

<p>As part of a response to the first part of this analysis, a friend pointed me to an <a href="http://kotaku.com/why-people-get-so-worked-up-about-canon-1688856413">examination of how we view canon</a> <sup>(<a href="http://www.webcitation.org/6WrSMmtox">cite</a>)</sup>. There are a number of different aspects to the relationship between epistemology and canon.</p>

<p>A television series presents an interesting situation; it poses the question of how to deal with a single work, generally under the care of multiple auteurs, in the form of multiple directors over the course of a single season/series. In traditional multiple episode television works, the story arc writers function as primary auteurs, using a “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible_%28writing%29">bible</a>” to attempt to keep epistemic consistency across works. Deviances can (and have been) introduced when interpreted by individual episode directors.</p>

<p>With multi-medium canon, spanning graphic novels, television, film, et al, the potential problems maintaining a single definitive canon multiply. It’s difficult enough to maintain canon between films or television episodes in the same medium, but, as each storytelling medium has its own caveats and rules, there are differences in the way that information is conveyed – not to mention that the presence of multiple auteurs (specific to each medium) would provide a potentially corrupting influence on the epistemology specific to the canon.</p>

<p>An example of this could be seen to be the interactions between large canon works, such as some of the DC comics universe works (i.e. Batman, Superman) and the television and film adaptations of those same works.</p>

<h2 id="altering-canon----and-the-burden-of-appeasing-fandom">Altering canon – and the burden of appeasing fandom</h2>

<p>The auteurs involved in the adaptations will sometimes drastically alter canon – <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0279600/">Smallville</a> and Singer’s <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0348150/">Superman Returns</a> in the case of the Superman franchise, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3749900/">Gotham</a> and Burton’s <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096895/">Batman</a> as examples in the case of the Batman franchise. Some of these works override / ignore existing canon, while some of them provide prequel and sequel material; for the moment, the question I’d like to pose is “what does a prequel or sequel <em>owe</em> canonical epistemology?”</p>

<p>There are a few things which I believe should be taken into account when trying to determine the answer to that question.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Intent</strong>. What is the intention of the prequel/sequel? Putting aside the general overriding motive of monetary gain, motivations can generally be split between a primary financial motivation to profit off of the material or an intention to either “re-imagine” the canon (assuming that the auteur can produce a superior outcome) or augment the canon. A primarily financial motive will most likely result in the canonical epistemology being set aside for the sake of increasing or pleasing the target demographic.</li>
  <li><strong>Integrity</strong>. It seems as thought the vast majority of epistemic extension and exploration is done without much consideration for the impact on both the integrity and the closure of the film’s epistemology. Considerate works which are considering attaching themselves to existing epistemology of a larger canon should be considering these factors before altering the epistemology. Any addition to canonical epistemology changes both the perception of prior works and potentially their emotional impact in retrospect.</li>
</ul>

<p>Fandom have devoted time and/or money to a “franchise”, presumably because they identify or sympathize with something espoused in the larger canon. Because of this largely emotional attachment to the larger body of work, fandom can place a great emphasis on preserving the present state of canon and keeping the epistemology intact – or perhaps as close to the state in which they originally found it when they became attached to the canonical works. This temporal attachment goes toward explaining why, for example, fans of <a href="http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Doctor_Who">Doctor Who</a> generally tend to view the incarnation of the Doctor which was their first introduction to the series as the subjectively “best” incarnation of that character.</p>

<p>There is another possibility inherent in the relationship between fandom and epistemology, which is that the viewer will (almost obsessively) attempt to seek out any epistemic closure or extension which is offered to them. I posit that it is the result of a deep emotional attachment to the characters and situations present in the canon which cause the viewer to attempt to create the most vivid knowledge-set of the canon and attempt to achieve epistemic closure.</p>

<h2 id="expectations--the-burden-of-context">Expectations ; the burden of context</h2>

<p>The context in which we view the epistemic system of a film, or the subjective epistemology, is almost as important as the objective epistemology given by the subject film.</p>

<p>The emotional and subjective knowledge baggage we bring into a film don’t necessarily have to have been introduced by other works in a canon. They could have come from other films in the same genre, adaptations of written works with similar subject material, earlier attempts at adapting the source material from the film, or even subjective life experiences of the viewer.</p>

<h2 id="reboot----uncorrupting-the-epistemology">Reboot – uncorrupting the epistemology?</h2>

<p>Over time, epistemology of a canon can become corrupted, self-contradictory, or suffer an overall loss in quality. One of the accepted methods for uncorrupting the epistemology of a larger work has been the <em>reboot</em>, another is retroactive continuity, or “retconning”, which has been used extensively in graphic novel and comic works as well as <a href="https://matthewkirshenblatt.wordpress.com/2013/12/24/time-travel-and-retconning-revisionism-and-reconstructionism-in-doctor-who/">television and film</a> <sup>(<a href="http://www.webcitation.org/6WrTwHOTQ">cite</a>)</sup>. There are a number of different successful methodologies which have been used for epistemic resets through reboots:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Complete epistemic do-over</strong>. This involves a disregarding of the entire literal epistemology, perhaps keeping some of the more commonly regarded portions of the canon, most likely to appease the target demographic’s past connection with prior incarnations. Examples of this would include the multiple Batman series reboots (Burton, Nolan), as well as the recent Spiderman reboots.</li>
  <li><strong>Time Travel Adjustment</strong>. This is when a series simply invents a <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicRetcon">time-travel type retcon or reset</a> in order to change basic principals of the epistemology. This differs from complete epistemic reconfigurations because the original continuity and epistemology is respected and then explained away or altered through the use of a time-travel narrative device. Popular examples of this include Abrams’ <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0796366/">Star Trek</a> reboot, and the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1340138/">Terminator: Genisys</a> film. Zemeckis’s <a href="">Back to the Future</a> franchise worked almost entirely by turning this concept into a plot device – a concept mirrored by the recent <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3148266/">12 Monkeys</a> television series, but ironically not from its source material, the Gilliam <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114746/">Twelve Monkeys</a> film.</li>
  <li><strong>Hand Wave</strong>. Quite possibly the <em>laziest</em> form of epistemic reset. It generally involves simply ignoring certain aspects of previous epistemology in the canon or offering a glib explanation – usually prior films within a designated series. A general example of this would be the <em>Highlander</em> sequels, although it has also been part of a fairly well known <em>Doctor Who</em> trope for the majority of the run of the show.</li>
  <li><strong>Revisionist Adjustment</strong>. Adjusting portions of an already established epistemology for the purpose of correcting perceived mistakes or inadequacies. An example of this would be the introduction of Darth Vader as Luke Skywalker’s father in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080684/">Empire Strikes Back</a> after it was explained through explicit narrative exposition in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/">A New Hope</a> that Vader had <em>murdered</em> Luke’s father; it was <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">retconned</a> during <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086190/">Return of the Jedi</a> through a particularly clumsy dialogue-based hand wave. (This is only one of many, many examples of retroactive continuity in the Star Wars universe.)</li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Narrative exposition</strong>, or simply <strong>exposition</strong>, is the insertion of important background information within a story; for example, information about the setting, characters’ back-stories, prior plot events, historical context, etc. (from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposition_%28narrative%29">Wikipedia</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Within the confines of the skeleton of a film work (the script), there are many ways to impart information which would not otherwise be assumed by the viewer or implied by the filmmaker. I posit that the way in which expository information is imparted to a viewer via the medium of film is as important <em>if not more important</em> than the information which is being imparted.</p>

<p>As with any other aspect of film as an art form and medium, there isn’t a single “correct” way of doing anything. There isn’t one particular correct framing which needs to be used for a shot, not only a single focal length lens or camera brand which would have to be used to get the only valid shot possible – and in much the same vein, there are many different more-or-less-equally-correct methods of imparting that information. I’d like to explore the mechanisms and caveats of each of them.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="objectivity-and-subjectivity">Objectivity and Subjectivity</h2>

<p>It’s an interesting concept – there is no real delineation between objectivity and subjectivity as far as narration goes, if we consider that any narration is part of the <a href="/2015/02/26/film-epistemology/">artificially separate epistemic system of a film</a>, and therefore could have a level of objectivity or subjectivity within the confines of a certain character, but which presents the same objective face to the viewing audience as a whole (in that they all will see the same footage), which will be subjectively interpreted by each viewer (since even though they physically see the same footage, each person subjectively interprets what they see differently).</p>

<p>If we view the epistemology of the film as a system which we mentally “enter” during the course of film viewing, we can attempt to assign a level of subjectivity or objectivity <em>within those parameters</em> to determine how objective exposition appears to be <em>within that system</em>. This is the virtual vantage point which I will be using during the remainder of my analysis of different forms of exposition, so as not to overly confuse the concepts.</p>

<h2 id="narrative-exposition--through-narration">Narrative exposition … through narration</h2>

<p>One of the most popular methods for imparting information to the audience of a film (or other visual work) is by simply having either a character (through a monologue or soliloquy) tell the audience the pieces of the story or other details which the auteurs wish to impart, directly speak to the audience through a voiceover, or espouse the information through a conversation between characters – or even a character who exists <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrExposition">only to spout expository information</a>.</p>

<p>Out of all of these methodologies, I tend to look down on voiceover narration as the most egregious, because it comes across as an indicator of either laziness or over-complexity, as the auteurs did not believe that the information could be imparted in any way <em>other than essentially having the film universe speak through a disembodied voice directly to the viewer</em>, even if it comes by way of a character. (I make the distinction between a voiceover of a diary being written or read and this type of narration, simply because a diary-type voiceover would otherwise fall under being categorized as a soliloquy.)</p>

<h2 id="captioncrawl-exposition">Caption/crawl exposition</h2>

<p>Popularized in modern cinema by George Lucas’s Star Wars intro crawl but dating back to silent movie title cards, crawl exposition is more or less a written form of voiceover narration, presented in a slightly varied form. It could be argued that caption/crawl titles actually present a perceptually higher level of objectivity to the viewer, as they speak with an omniscient deity-like authority rather than speaking through an anonymous narrator or using a character as a puppet of sorts.</p>

<h2 id="mise-en-scne-exposition">Mise-en-scène exposition</h2>

<p>This is where my cinematography sensibilities come in. There are many methods of using the camera as a virtual narrator, and it is a very powerful tool to use, since the camera’s recorded mise-en-scène is the lens by which the viewer perceives the whole of the film universe. This gives the filmmaker great latitude in deciding how much or how little information can be imparted from the framing and composition alone, before the actors’ dialogue or motions are considered at all.</p>

<p>Some even consider the camera to be its own character, and though this is fairly specific to directors and cinematographers, being</p>

<p>In the interests of space and time, I’ll just briefly overview some of the more successful methods.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Frame Composition</strong>. I’ll refer to <a href="https://vimeo.com/118078262">Tony Zhou’s breakdown of Kurosawa’s The Bad Sleep Well</a> for a more in-depth analysis of how the way elements dance in and out of frame and are arranged <em>in a single shot</em> can tell us more about the characters than pages of dialogue or a flurry of quick cuts.</li>
  <li><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2011/01/fight-club.html">Frontality</a>. The way a character can be looking directly at the viewer (although, to be fair, we only <em>perceive</em> that they’re looking directly at us, and for the most part, the camera is taking the place of another character) can subconsciously impart a wealth of information. It allows us to put ourselves in the place of one of the characters, and the way we perceive them can shift.</li>
  <li><strong>Lighting</strong>. Even though particular film idioms like film noir are specifically known for using lighting for exposition, neo-noir films have brought this technique back into the mainstream. Using visual idioms like casting bars of shadow across a character’s face to indicate that they feel trapped or cornered, for example.</li>
  <li><strong>Objectivity/Subjectivity</strong> can be implied by the type of shot used, and even the level of stabilization employed. If we need to get into a character’s head to imply thought, many cinematographers have used dolly-in closeup shots to imply figuratively going into the character’s head (or in the case of the intro to <strong>Fight Club</strong>, literally coming out of it).</li>
  <li><strong>3D Forced Perspective</strong>. I don’t particularly like “3D” films, especially as they generally come off like large pop-up books to me, but the ability to force certain objects to be more apparent, and therefore more important, by using 3D manipulation is another fairly effective tool. If a sword appears to be a few inches from your nose in a movie theater, you’re going to be paying attention to it.</li>
  <li><strong>Montage theory</strong>. Exposition introduced through the process of editing is another method, more firmly in the realm of post-production – and iterated in most texts on the Soviet theory of montage – which allows the juxtaposition of images and sounds to imply certain narrative exposition or foreshadowing. Cutting to reaction shots can coerce the viewer into associating those reactions directly with the content of the prior shot. This form is quite prevalent in many visual mediums, including film, television, and graphic novels.</li>
</ul>

<p>These can be used in conjunction with one another, or, as in the case of De Palma’s <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117060/">Mission Impossible</a>, they can be used to deliver contradictory viewpoints. In <em>Mission Impossible</em>’s first reveal sequence, Voight’s character allows Cruise’s character to use dialogue to confirm his intended exposition – which is false – but De Palma shows a series of flashback sequences from slightly different angles, revealing the true nature of the exposition, even as Cruise’s voiceover contradicts it. Cruise is lying to Voight, but telling <em>us</em> the truth.</p>

<h2 id="holistic-exposition">Holistic exposition</h2>

<p>Holistic exposition is the dissemination of information through observed character movements, actions, and observed and inferred intents. An auteur can impart vast amounts of information through the situations and non-discrete expositional phrasing. (I make the distinction between “holistic exposition” and “mise-en-scène exposition”, even though the latter is a subset of the former, for the sake of dividing between camera-based exposition and all other types of holistic exposition.)</p>

<p>For example, if a character is lonely, the character does not have to state “I am lonely” for the viewer to understand the character’s loneliness. It is just as effective, if not more so, to allow situations to unfold where the character is allowed to <em>imply</em> that same loneliness by actions, or even in non-explicit dialogue.</p>

<p>There are a number of caveats to holistic exposition.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Intellectual Laziness</em>. There’s a certain percentage of any viewing demographic that does not want to have to <em>think</em> about how information is presented – they just want the characters to come out and say whatever they’re thinking.</li>
  <li><em>Ambiguity</em> can be introduced unintentionally if there is more than one potential cause or source for the holistic expositional element. Is the character picking up a knife because they’re scared, hungry, or angry?</li>
  <li><em>Actors</em> make or break this style of exposition. If the actors lack subtlety or under- (or over-) act their part, it can destroy carefully planned exposition.</li>
  <li><em>Planning</em>. It requires much more subtlety to reveal information through holistic means than to simply tell the viewer what you want them to know, which requires a greater level of planning from the writing on down to the director in the chain of auteurship.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="respecting-holistic-epistemology-or-only-tell-what-you-need-to-survive">Respecting holistic epistemology (or “Only tell what you need to survive”)</h2>

<p>Not everything has to be explicitly told or known for a story or universe to be complete. As I had mentioned in my first piece of film epistemology, epistemic closure isn’t a necessary thing; the lack of it can has the ability to change the perception of a film by the viewers.</p>

<p>It should be noted that some of the wave of independent filmmakers starting in the 1990s seemed to rely on over-telling stories by introducing potentially irrelevant information to the plot through over-loquacious characters who buried their narrative exposition in paragraphs of misleading dialogue. Kevin Smith and Quentin Tarantino are two examples of this school of narrative over-exposition, but there have been many who have attempted the same techniques with varying levels of success. (It takes a certain level of craft to create dialogue which works this way but does not come off as cloyingly banal or irritatingly uninteresting.)</p>

<h2 id="dark-city-an-exercise-in-comparison">“Dark City”, an exercise in comparison</h2>

<p>Alex Proyas’ gothic neo-noir/horror/sci-fi classic <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118929/">Dark City</a> offers a very apparent dichotomic illustration of the differences in narrative exposition choices. The theatrical cut begins with a paragraph of indulgent voice-over narration provided by Kiefer Sutherland’s character (spoilers, of course):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>First, there was darkness. Then came the Strangers. They were a race as old as time itself. They had mastered the ultimate technology – ability to alter physical reality by will alone. They called this ability “Tuning.” But they were dying. Their civilization was in decline, and so they abandoned their world, seeking a cure for their own mortality. Their endless journey brought them to a small, blue world… in the farthest corner of the galaxy. Our world. Here, they thought they had finally found… what they had been searching for. My name is Dr. Daniel Poe Schreber. I am just a man. I help the Strangers conduct their experiments. I have betrayed my own kind. <em>(courtesy of <a href="http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/d/dark-city-script-transcript-proyas.html">script-o-rama</a>)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The narration sets up the basics of the plot, and now the viewer knows far more than any of the principal characters other than <em>Dr. Shreber</em>. The other principals spend the majority (at least two thirds) of the film coming up to speed with this information, while we watch along – textbook objective viewing.</p>

<p>The director’s cut, however cuts out the narration entirely, as well as extending some scenes to add additional dialogue and action to help round out certain parts of the plot. The major change which this has on the perceptual quality of the film is that we don’t know what the characters know (unknown knowns), and we don’t know what the characters don’t know (unknown unknowns). This, at least in theory, gives us greater subjectivity in our relationship to the perceptions and situations of the principal characters. <em>We don’t even know the name for the villains until the third act.</em> It also creates the potential for a fair amount of confusion in the first act, as we don’t know <em>anything</em> outside of what we holistically learn – John Murdock wakes up in a bathtub near a corpse, and someone is chasing him.</p>

<p>I found that while viewing the director’s cut of Dark City, the “larger truth” (or the “bigger lie”, depending on your perception) behind the city seemed to come as more of a revelation. I say “seemed to come” as I’m incapable of watching a second version of the film in a totally objective light ; my context has been clouded by my previous viewings. For example, it’s less noticeable that there is never any sunlight, as the characters seem blissfully unaware of that detail.</p>
