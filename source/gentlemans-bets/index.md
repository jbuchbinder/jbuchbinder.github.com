description: Bets with my friend Chris
---

This is a list of "Gentleman's Bets" which I have undertaken with my friend
Chris. We decide on our predicted outcomes for certain large-scale events,
mainly political and/or scientific, and wager one or more cups of coffee.

The loser has to provide the victor with the designated number of cups of
coffee at the end of the bet period.
