I think that after reading things like [this][1] about taxpayer outrage at executive level bankers raking in performance bonuses for apparently [tanking the world financial system][2], I’m starting to think that we’re wrong about the outrage.

Not that we shouldn’t be outraged about funnelling money to jackholes who buy and sell people like me during lunch … more that they really should get performance bonuses if it’s based on \*performance\*.

Look at what they’ve done: the [upward motion of wealth][3] from [retirement funds][4] and other [previously untouchable funding sources][5], along with the [end of the ownership society][6], yet their stockholders are still seeing money thanks to [wheelbarrow loads of cash money straight from your grandkids’ future earnings][7]. They’re raiding the \*federal\* coffers, eating tax money previously only available for bombing dark people and educating children, and moving that money into their vaults. I mean, if that isn’t an amazing performance, what is?

They tank the system, then get our money. Take a bow, you fat greedy pig fuckers. Hopefully a few more of you get [cold-cocked][8] before this thing blows over.
