  <div class="entry-content"><p>Maybe you’ve divined from the title that I’m not exactly a supporter of the Olympics.</p>

<p>Of course, I have quite a few reasons why I don’t like them, and why I’m boycotting watching or having anything to do with the <a href="http://en.beijing2008.cn/">Olympic Games 2008 in Beijing</a>.</p>

<p><strong>1) Human Rights.</strong> Honestly, I don’t think I even have a leg to stand on with regard to this particular issue. It’s not like we <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2005-11-07-bush-terror-suspects_x.htm">torture people</a>, <a href="http://www.thepriceofliberty.org/04/04/26/lang.htm">stifle or censor the press</a>, <a href="http://www.truthout.org/article/exclusive-emails-detail-rnc-voter-supression-5-states">supress opinion or fundamental rights</a>, or <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views06/0619-22.htm">occupy a sovereign nation</a> or anything. Do you feel a <a href="http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=37416">surge</a> of guilt yet? Still, we shouldn’t exactly be *endorsing* this sort of thing by going. But how can we prove that <a href="http://www.thismodernworld.org/arc/1990/90big-guns.gif">America is the best hung nation on the planet</a> unless we show ‘em the size of our <a href="http://www.scienceprogress.org/2008/08/doping-enhancement-olympics/">chemically enhanced collective wang</a>? Which brings me to point two…</p>

<p><strong>2) Nationalism is Racism.</strong> The very idea that one person is superior to another one just because of where they were born, live, or what they look like. Not like we ever <a href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAslavery.htm">did something awful</a> <a href="http://www.historyonthenet.com/WW2/japan_internment_camps.htm">like that before</a>. Still, we’re talking about a set of games which were supposed to promote “goodwill” among nations, and yet has turned into more of a <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/olympics/history/story/2008/05/11/f-olympics-history-1996.html">violent</a> <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/orig6/nicholas7.html">pissing contest</a> than anything else. The ancient greeks would have been disappointed, I guess, in between bouts of <a href="http://www.religionfacts.com/homosexuality/ancient_greeks.htm">pederasty</a>.</p>

<p><strong>3. Jim Thorpe.</strong> Assuming he’s not spinning in his grave, one of the greatest athletes of the 20th century would probably have reminded you that <a href="http://www.essortment.com/all/jimthorpeolymp_refp.htm">he had his olympic gold medals stripped from him</a> for accepting a few bucks to play a baseball game. What difference could that possibly make, you ask yourself? Well, the Olympics was originally conceived as a way for *amateur* athletes from all over the world to compete, not professionals, hence the removal of Mr Thorpe’s medals. But wait a minute …. isn’t there a <a href="http://www.foxsports.com.au/beijing_olympics/story/0,27313,24147887-5014104,00.html">USA Dream Team</a> (starring none other than Mr <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/LAW/07/24/findlaw.analysis.dorf.kobe.bryant/index.html">Date Rape</a> himself) playing in the Olympics? That’s right, they <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/forum/july96/olympics_7-23.html">changed the rules</a> so we can swing our <a href="http://www.crooksandliars.com/2008/05/01/happy-mission-accomplished-day/">Nationalist banana hammock</a> around. Fuck fair play, man, <em>game over</em>. If you have to put <a href="http://www.insidehoops.com/nbasalaries.shtml">paid ringers</a> in there, where is your nationalist superiority?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I remember this great, wonderful feeling that America was a nation of innovators. That no matter what the problem is, we would have no trouble solving it with some good ol’ fashioned American “know how”.</p>

<p>What happened?</p>

<p>We have a pharmaceutical industry which in 1999 brought in around <a href="http://www.actupny.org/reports/durban-licensing.html">100 *billion* dollars for the top three companies</a> with profits usually above 20%. Yet when was the last time we actually *cured* anything? Fucking <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poliomyelitis">polio</a>. I’m not counting shots you <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_vaccine">have to get periodically</a>, that isn’t really a “cure” for anything, or things that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HPV_vaccine">may stop something which may cause something else</a>. Where’s that cure for cancer we’ve been researching for years?</p>

<p>Maybe it’s just easier to keep people buying drugs to allow them to live rather than curing what’s wrong with them. That sounds awful and callous. I could swear there was a <a href="http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Symbiosis_(episode)">Star Trek episode about just that</a> ….</p>

<p>Back to innovation. I understand that profits are supposed to spur innovation, which seems to be the crux behind current copyright and patent law. Why the hell is the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0019422/">same stupid mouse</a> <a href="http://www.keytlaw.com/Copyrights/sonybono.htm">being juiced</a> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0784896/">even now</a>? (I’m sure good ol’ Walt is pushing up the daisies, and isn’t profiting much from this.) Where exactly is the “innovation” in all of this? I mean, Disney bought out Pixar in 2006 so that it could get into the high-end 3D animation world, but where has it exactly innovated before then? I guess they innovated by retelling <a href="http://www.apva.org/history/pocahont.html">the story of Pocohontas</a>, leaving out the part where she was dragged around Europe as a curiosity, or perhaps by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freaky_Friday_(1976_film)">remaking old crappy movies</a>? Or perhaps by <a href="http://www.kimbawlion.com/rant2.htm">ripping off a smaller company, denying it and making untold fortunes</a>?</p>

<p>Not to say we have a fully capitalist economy, since we definitely don’t. Our present policy of socializing losses by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Schwartz">incompetent</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cayne">morons</a> (who couldn’t resist hiding from the emperor that he had no clothes on), and yet denying that same level of protection to medical needs. Guess we need to make sure these fuckers can earn their 35 million dollar salaries and 16 million dollar bonuses, which we’ll get to pay later. Oh yeah, and the people who lost all that money investing in their firm? While Shwartz and Cayne get their <a href="http://www.momentonmoney.com/2008/07/soft-landings-a.html">golden parachutes</a>, the ordinary people investing in their supposedly safe firm get the <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=golden shower">golden shower</a>. There’s your “trickle down economics” at work. Remember how this should encourage innovation and good performance? Riiiiight. </p>

<p>Ever since <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/history/presidents/rr40.html">Saint Ron</a> decided that government regulation was bad, but that we couldn’t trust people to make up their own minds about anything (legislating morality), we’ve seen some nasty, nasty fallout. We imprison <a href="http://www.drugwarfacts.org/prison.htm">way too many</a> people for drug related offences, since we have to declare war on everything, but somehow we <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/25576784/">can’t possibly keep people from dumping crap into our environment</a>. I’m sure if the founding fathers wanted us to all be White and Protestant, they would have written in a “no marriage for teh gays” line right next to the part about this being a Christian country, and how the President has <a href="http://www.americanrevolution.com/KingGeorge3rd.htm">all encompassing, King-like powers</a>. Oh, wait, they didn’t.</p>

<p>Damn, keep getting off track. America. Not innovating.</p>

<p>We’re still using the same damn space shuttle design we made back in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_shuttle">1981</a>. You’d figure in almost thirty years, we would have something a bit more impressive, maybe? How’s that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonization_of_the_Moon">moon base</a> coming, anyways? Oh, that’s right, we had to divert our attentions towards the terrorists communists. How did that turn out? Did Saint Ron knock the Berlin wall down with one swing of his mighty fifty foot penis? Or did it collapse on itself, as most predicted it would? Yeah, I thought so. Did we ever get back on track? I think not. Our current <a href="http://www.bushorchimp.com">moron</a> in chief has been systematically dismantling <a href="http://memory.loc.gov/learn/features/timeline/depwwii/newdeal/newdeal.html">the legacy of FDR</a>, all while telling us that we should just privatize everything. How is <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iVAF4FNNGCiKCJfNJMp-FCePBQxAD92E5QL00">that</a> working out for you? Shouldn’t they be able to innovate more, since they make profits, being a private company. Fools.</p>

<p>I just want to see an America where we don’t simply repeat the latest <a href="http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1829354,00.html">talking point</a> until it becomes fact as it is spewed by <a href="http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/home/today.guest.html">some fat pill-popping wanker with a microphone</a>. When people are saying “America sucks”, maybe instead of branding them all as traitors, we should be asking “why?”… “Why do you think this great land ain’t so great anymore?”</p>

<p>I want to see an America where people don’t have to work two jobs for survival. Where we are <a href="http://www.milesev.com/">inventing practical electric cars</a>, not <a href="http://www.chevrolet.com/electriccar/">playing catch up</a>. I want to see an America where we know that “energy policy” isn’t a dirty word, and sure isn’t swahili for “drill until there’s nothing left and we’re completely boned.”</p>

<p>I want to see an America which isn’t motivated by Nascar, Jerry Springer, the WWE, and every other pathetic form of entertainment out there. How can we be innovators and world leaders when we <a href="http://www.slowfood.com/">can’t even cook our own food anymore</a>? How can we care about our world when some dumb-ass celebrities’ babies are somehow more important?</p>

<p>We should be ashamed, but not of our country. We can’t blame *any* of this on politicians. After all, besides Diebold and <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/justices/scalia.bio.html">some stupid wankers on the Supreme Court</a>, don’t we put these turkeys where they are? Aren’t we the ones eating the fast food, driving the big SUVs, and <a href="http://www.intelligentdesign.org/">ignoring science in its entirety</a>? We deserve whatever is going to happen to us. Maybe if everything collapses, we’ll have to get off our fast food inflated butts and remember how to innovate. I can only hope.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’m writing you, the good people of the <a href="http://www.mta.info/">MTA</a>, to thank you for the ride on the Metro North train to New Haven yesterday.</p>

<p>The complimentary sauna included with the train ride left me peeling myself off the seat, and the lack of any openable window compounded this. I think I’m a few pounds lighter for the experience.</p>

<p>All kidding aside, this leads me to ask a simple, stupid question: Why aren’t we funding public transportation in this country? A ride on the Metro North costs about <a href="http://business.inquirer.net/money/breakingnews/view/20080605-140842/Fed-chief-says-US-inflation-is-too-high">16 USD</a> one way from New Haven to Grand Central station, which still is more expensive than the ride in a <a href="http://members.greenpeace.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=536">gas-guzzling air-conditioned SUV</a> at the current petrol prices. I can’t help but think that if we hadn’t been <a href="http://www.costofwar.com/">pissing money down the toilet</a> while <a href="http://www.tiltingatwindmills.org.uk/grca/biglie.htm">tilting at windmills</a> in sand dunes halfway around the world, we could have sunk some of that money into improving, <a href="http://www.patransit.org/information/subsidy.htm">subsidizing</a> (gasp! not subsidizing! what will conservatives say!) and maybe even air-conditioning our public transportation.</p>

<p>That being said, we could also try using solar power, since the train lines take up a pretty large amount of ground space, to subsidize the drain on the power grid. I know, I know, it doesn’t have quite the ring that “<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/fyi/news/03/22/iraq.war/">shock and awe</a>” has, but at least it might have a net positive effect on the world. Wouldn’t that be nice for a change?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just had a fascinating phone conversation with one of my more conservative friends. He proceeded to tell me how <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/01/22/obama.madrassa/">Obama is a muslim</a>, <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CEEDC123CF936A25753C1A965958260">Clinton let terrorists into the country</a>, <a href="http://www.theleftcoaster.com/archives/010087.php">Clinton abandoned our valiant troops in Somalia</a> (I think they call this “cut and run” now), and how <a href="http://www.thebostonchannel.com/helenthomas/8512055/detail.html">McCain is a true compromiser</a> with <a href="http://www.pej.org/html/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=5606&amp;mode=thread&amp;order=0&amp;thold=0">integrity in his beliefs</a>. The best part was how he told me that he formulated these opinions himself, since five minutes and <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2006/10/23/bush-says-he-uses-the-google/">The Google</a> will tell you otherwise. You should note that if you didn’t know that Clinton/Somalia piece was about the Somalia conflict, it would almost read like a certain <a href="http://www.bushorchimp.com/">chimpy president</a> and his Middle Eastern policy.</p>

<p>It just never ceases to amaze me, the incredible <strong>*stupidity*</strong>, or at least lack of willingness to doubt crackpots at their word, which hangs over this country. And what a short memory we have…. McCain was the <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/politics/president/articles/2004/03/21/the_anatomy_of_a_smear_campaign/">victim of such a hitjob</a> when running against our current poor excuse for a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdeCl1ZDYwo">drunk</a> <a href="http://www.buzzflash.com/articles/contributors/312">loser</a> of a President back in 2000 for the GOP nomination. Now, just as he endorses torture after having been a victim of it, he does the <a href="http://weblogs.sun-sentinel.com/news/politics/blog/2007/11/mccain_disavows_nh_push_poll_s.html">same kind of hitjob attacks</a> on his opponent. Now *that* is integrity, or something. I think I’m leaning towards the something.</p>

<p>If you’re going to dislike someone, do it based on how they play in the role they’re vying for. If someone is running for congress, evaluate them on what kind of Congressman they’d be, not whether or not you’d want to drink a beer with them. I want a President who is, at the least, brighter than I am. Being more respected and a better leader would also be requirements for the job. For some, inexplicable reason, Americans love to pick they person they think has the best “character”, attends church with the most regularity, and would be a good candidate to date their daughter.</p>

<p>Maybe we do deserve the last eight years of plague …</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I finally got around to getting a 12VDC power supply for the car (15 USD, cheap!), so my <a href="http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?c=L_Product_C2&amp;childpagename=US/Layout&amp;pagename=Linksys/Common/VisitorWrapper&amp;cid=1160093298732">WRT54G3G-ST</a> is mobile, and I got to enjoy trying out <a href="http://www.skype.com/">Skype</a> while doing 65mph on the Mass Pike.</p>

<p>There’s some sort of gee-whiz factor in all this, but I guess it’s just another way to become more and more endlessly connected.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Another day, another project …</p>

<p>A few days ago I put together an <a href="http://www.nslu2-linux.org/">NSLU2</a>-based load balancer using <a href="http://1wt.eu/articles/2006_lb/">haproxy</a> to do the load balancing.</p>

<p>If you don’t have an NSLU2, go get one. Those things are incredible, and ridiculously useful. I’m using OpenSlug/BE, but any distro is awesome on these things.</p>

<p><em>Hint: It takes some manual hacking of the haproxy.conf file and the init script to get it working from the optware packages. Of course, you have to tune it for the application you’re running…</em></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you’ve ever been stuck booting an old machine with a bad CD drive, or worse yet, <em>no</em> CD drive and an old enough BIOS not to properly boot a USB drive, you’ve experienced the wallbanger I have today. (and no, PXE boot wasn’t an option)</p>

<p>Fortunately, it appears that there is a nice boot floppy which allows booting via network or USB, which is available at … Direct link to the zipped floppy disk image is at <a href="http://etherboot.org/wiki/index.php">etherboot.org</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’ve had a Sprint Motorola RAZR v3m for a while, and when the time came to move to a Blackberry (for work), getting the information off of it would have been a horrendous process.</p>

<p>Instead, I present a pretty simple way of doing this using the Subversion version of opensync’s sync-moto script. Note that I did this under Ubuntu 7.10 (Gutsy Gibbon):</p>

<p>• Get the id by using lsusb:<br />
$ <strong>lsusb</strong><br />
Bus 005 Device 001: ID 0000:0000<br />
Bus 003 Device 001: ID 0000:0000<br />
Bus 002 Device 001: ID 0000:0000<br />
Bus 004 Device 003: ID 0483:2016 SGS Thomson Microelectronics Fingerprint Reader<br />
Bus 004 Device 002: ID 0a5c:2110 Broadcom Corp.<br />
Bus 004 Device 001: ID 0000:0000<br />
Bus 001 Device 003: ID 22b8:2a64 Motorola PCS<br />
Bus 001 Device 002: ID 046d:0a02 Logitech, Inc.<br />
Bus 001 Device 001: ID 0000:0000<br />
• Add the following definition under /etc/modprobe.d/somethingorother :<br />
<strong>alias cdc_acm usbserial<br />
options vendor=0x22b8 product=0x2a64</strong><br />
• Plug in the phone and issue a:<br />
** sudo /sbin/modprobe cdc_acm vendor=0x22b8 product=0x2a64**<br />
• Download the Subversion copy of the opensync moto-sync plugin from:</p>

<p>https://svn.opensync.org/plugins/moto-sync/</p>

<p>• Issue the following sync command:<br />
<strong>./mototool -d /dev/ttyUSB0 –backup –file mybackupfile.csv</strong></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had a bit of a revelation the other day. Natasha and I had gone to pick up food to bring to a small dinner party, although it wasn’t a very formal occasion. She, on a lark, decided to grab one of those ridiculous celebrity tabloid-type magazines to read in the car on the way over.</p>

<p>The cashier, who looked to be somewhere between her mid forties and fifties, reacted with much excitement, and started talking to Natasha about some of the celebrities mentioned on the cover. None of this would have been very interesting, until I hear her start defending one of them. She said that it “wasn’t fair” that they were treating the celebrity “like that”, and that “she’s too good for that”. As if she knew her.</p>

<p>And something that has made a lot of sense to a lot of other people finally clicked in my head. A forty to fifty year old woman working a dead end cashiering job in the middle of nowhere doesn’t have anything to look forward to, and probably won’t ever attain any measure of fame and fortune. But by living vicariously through the glossy images in the impulse purchase area, she gets to feel as though she has some great connection. I used to think that welfare and Jerry Springer were our modern day bread and circus combination, but maybe that’s not it.</p>

<p>When you feel that you’re part of something bigger than yourself, you have some sort of purpose, and that the Universe is a sane, fair and rational place. You ignore poverty, poor health, overwork and stress, and instead focus on a place where the Universe revolves around you. Not exactly a “<a href="http://www.damninteresting.com/?p=864">Total Perspective Vortex</a>“, if you catch my drift. Maybe it’s just as much a way of getting by as betting the house on a better afterlife, or blowing all of your spare change on lottery tickets. I can’t exactly complain about it, since I think the perception of happiness trumps the reality of misery almost every time.</p>

<p>Pass the remote control, I’m tired of this station.</p>
