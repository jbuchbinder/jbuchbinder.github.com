It has been a little while since I have posted anything musical here, so it’s about time to get back on that track. I’ve received two presents … from myself … a [Line 6 Bass PODxt Live][1] and a [Behringer VX-2496 Vocal Processor][2]. I have to admit, vocals and bass haven’t sounded that good in a long time. For those who don’t know, I have been an ardent bass player for years, and a Bass POD has been on the top of my list for years. I hope to post a few samples of output from that, soon.
