> *Michael Walon Praytor, Jr., 28, of Hampton died unexpectedly Saturday at his home. He was born February 1, 1979 in New Orleans, precious son of Michael Walon Praytor, Sr. of New Orleans and Jan Hunter Praytor of Canterbury. He married his beloved wife, Tammy Ann Conroy Praytor, on August 27, 2005 in Norwich. A 1998 graduate of Norwich Free Academy, he was a member of the touring company of Up With People and the irascible owner of The Sound Factory. Michael was a gifted musician, artist and entrepreneur. He had an adventurous spirit, charismatic personality and a passion for nature. We will always remember his endless love of his family, his outrageous sense of humor and his unrestrained honesty. Our hearts are broken. His time with us was too short, and he will be greatly missed but never forgotten. He will remain in the hearts of all who knew him.*
