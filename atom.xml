    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Terry Gilliam is, in my opinion, one of the great distinctive film directors of the latter part of the 20th century. Books have been written – literally – about his techniques and his rather unique style of filmmaking. I’m going to focus on one of my favorite films of his, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096764/">The Adventures of Baron Munchausen</a>, to study Gilliam’s artful reveal shots.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>A <em>reveal shot</em> is a shot where one or more visual element(s) are revealed to the viewer through either camera movement, movement in the mise-en-scène, or a combination of the two; the element(s) usually have some sort of significant relevance to the overall plot, as the reveal shot is usually regarded as a fairly powerful shot in a filmmaker’s arsenal.</p>

<p><em>Munchausen</em> is a <a href="http://jbuchbinder.com/2015/03/08/layers/">layered film</a>, and Gilliam transitions between the different layers of story and relative reality in relatively unusual ways, which I posit is to maintain the tenuous separation between these layers.</p>

<p>One of my favorite reveal shots in the film comes in the first act on a <em>literal</em> stage. The Baron has decided to elucidate what he considers to be the “real” version of events involving himself, as he stands in the narrator’s position on the stage as the curtain is lifted to reveal a set of the Sultan’s Palace, with all the lack-of-depth that such a stage set would afford:</p>

<p><img src="http://jbuchbinder.com/images/2015/03/munchausen-reveal-A-01.jpg" alt="A-01" /></p>

<p>As he begins to narrate, “The Grand Turk” (the Sultan) – or at least, the actor <em>playing</em> the Sultan in the Salts’ stage production – is pushed out to center stage, as if to prepare to play out the action being narrated by the Baron.</p>

<p><img src="http://jbuchbinder.com/images/2015/03/munchausen-reveal-A-02.jpg" alt="A-02" /></p>

<p>Gilliam flips back to The Baron so that he can tell a (relatively) personal anecdote about being granted access to the Sultan’s harem.</p>

<p><img src="http://jbuchbinder.com/images/2015/03/munchausen-reveal-A-03.jpg" alt="A-03" /></p>

<p>We then flip to a side view – what we can only assume is, more or less, a POV shot from The Baron’s point of view. We see the stage hands and the rest of the cast, urging the actor playing the Sultan to move forward.</p>

<p><img src="http://jbuchbinder.com/images/2015/03/munchausen-reveal-A-04.jpg" alt="A-04" /></p>

<p>He then begins to move forward. Notice that, right now, we’re completely in the theater, and this character is the <em>actor</em> <strong>playing</strong> the Sultan.</p>

<p><img src="http://jbuchbinder.com/images/2015/03/munchausen-reveal-A-05.jpg" alt="A-05" /></p>

<p>We move forward a few frames, and we see that, rather than the front of the stage, we’re now seeing something that <em>wasn’t there</em> in the previous shots – guards. This is the image where he crosses what <em>should</em> be the threshold of the stage. To the left is the world of the theatre, to the right is … the palace.</p>

<p><img src="http://jbuchbinder.com/images/2015/03/munchausen-reveal-A-06.jpg" alt="A-06" /></p>

<p>Forward another second or so, and he has completely left the theater, and the character we see in front of us is no longer the <em>actor</em> playing the Sultan, but now <em>is</em> the Sultan.</p>

<p><img src="http://jbuchbinder.com/images/2015/03/munchausen-reveal-A-07.jpg" alt="A-07" /></p>

<p>Without any cutting during the transition, Gilliam has managed to transport us from one reality to another ; from one layer of film to another nested one. This didn’t require any special effects or camera tricks, but simply duplicating a small piece of the theater set (with lighting) adjacent to the edge of the palace set, allowing the juxtaposition of the two realities in a single seamless shot.</p>

<p>Another stylized reveal comes by way of a repeated shot, as part of three – more minor – reveal shots. When The Baron wins the wager with the Sultan, he’s told that he can have as much gold as “the strongest man can carry”. The treasurer opens a comically sized lock …</p>

<p><img src="http://jbuchbinder.com/images/2015/03/munchausen-reveal-B-01.jpg" alt="B-01" /></p>

<p>… to reveal what appears to be a few gold coins.</p>

<p><img src="http://jbuchbinder.com/images/2015/03/munchausen-reveal-B-02.jpg" alt="B-02" /></p>

<p>But which when we pull back …</p>

<p><img src="http://jbuchbinder.com/images/2015/03/munchausen-reveal-B-03.jpg" alt="B-03" /></p>

<p>… reveals a ridiculous pile of gold and treasure. The next shot shows a pile of treasure with a ladder.</p>

<p><img src="http://jbuchbinder.com/images/2015/03/munchausen-reveal-B-04.jpg" alt="B-04" /></p>

<p>We crane down…</p>

<p><img src="http://jbuchbinder.com/images/2015/03/munchausen-reveal-B-05.jpg" alt="B-05" /></p>

<p>… to reveal Albrecht holding everything on his shoulders.</p>

<p><img src="http://jbuchbinder.com/images/2015/03/munchausen-reveal-B-06.jpg" alt="B-06" /></p>

<p>Cut to the Baron, looking very smug. Note that this is the <em>same shot</em> used to show the subjective story about the Sultan’s harem from my earlier example, with the Baron appearing in roughly the same framing, but slightly more to the center of the frame. The Baron is front and center in this reality, as opposed to the off-kilter nature of the “real” world of the theater.</p>

<p><img src="http://jbuchbinder.com/images/2015/03/munchausen-reveal-B-07.jpg" alt="B-07" /></p>

<p>Then we repeat the earlier dolly-back shot to reveal exactly what the Baron and his minions have done with the Sultan’s treasure:</p>

<p><img src="http://jbuchbinder.com/images/2015/03/munchausen-reveal-B-08.jpg" alt="B-08" /></p>

<p><img src="http://jbuchbinder.com/images/2015/03/munchausen-reveal-B-09.jpg" alt="B-09" /></p>

<p>The framing and composition are the same, with the exception of Albrecht moving the treasure, which had been in the foreground in the previous shot, out of the comically small exit, and beating a hasty retreat.</p>

<p><em>In the interests of brevity, I’m breaking this post up into multiple parts, so that I can demonstrate more examples of the full range of reveal shots used by Gilliam in this film.</em></p>

    <link href="http://jbuchbinder.com/2015/03/21/house-of-cards-chapter-30-shot-reverse-shot/"/>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is a deconstruction of a single scene in Netflix’s <em>House of Cards</em>, from the <a href="http://house-of-cards.wikia.com/wiki/Chapter_30">fourth episode of the third season</a>.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>One of the most common conversational constructions in modern film and television is <em>shot / reverse shot</em>. It’s the usual way (using an approach forwarded by <a href="http://www.openculture.com/2014/11/a-visual-introduction-to-soviet-montage-theory-a-revolution-in-filmmaking.html">Soviet montage theory</a>) to show a conversation between two people by cutting between single shots of each person to establish that a conversation is taking place. Sometimes this is done with choker or half shots with a single character in frame, sometimes this is done with “over the shoulder” shots, where the other character appears in frame – though usually out of focus or not in the principal focal part of the frame.</p>

<p>Another, competing approach, is to reframe the shot to include characters, incorporating fewer cuts. Older cinema, such as Kurosawa’s <em>The Bad Sleep Well</em>, used this system for conveying conversation:</p>

<div class="embed-video-container"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/jGc-K7giqKM "></iframe></div>

<p>As this more holistic approach to film exposition and exposing conversation has fallen by the wayside, we have seen a drop in <a href="http://www.cinemetrics.lv/database.php">average shot length</a>. <em>The Bad Sleep Well</em> has an ASL of 15.9 seconds, but <em>The Avengers</em> has an ASL of somewhere between 2.8 and 5 seconds (depending on who measured it). <em>Breaking Bad</em>’s pilot episode had an ASL of 5.5 seconds, according to the same database, so we can see that the decrease in shot length is not limited to film.</p>

<p><em>Chapter 30</em> provides a good example of a well composed and executed shot / reverse shot, performed in a moderately unconventional style, in the hallway conversation between Heather Dunbar and Doug Stamper. The scene also has some trappings of classic horror and suspense film.</p>

<p>It starts when Dunbar receives a call from Stamper. She is still flanked by colleagues, but visually separated, as she is isolated by the narrow depth-of-field in the shot. Lighting on her face is good, and we can see that she’s supposed to be a relatively good person; at least, in the <em>House of Cards</em> pantheon of Gods and Demi-gods.</p>

<p><img src="http://jbuchbinder.com/images/2015/03/hoc-304-001.jpg" alt="001" /></p>

<p>As she looks down the hall, we’re treated to what must obviously be Dunbar’s point of view, with Stamper occupying a very small space in the frame – a shadow at the end of a hall. We’re immediately aware of the separation between the two, which includes not only their physical distance, but the professional separation between the two. Stamper could have simply come up to her, but as he says, “Stay where you are. We wouldn’t want to be seen together.”</p>

<p><img src="http://jbuchbinder.com/images/2015/03/hoc-304-002.jpg" alt="002" /></p>

<p>As Dunbar commits to the conversation, she moves into the center of the frame, and her colleagues are gone. She’s all alone, and we’re very aware that she is the most important thing in this conversation. The man in the shadows does not (yet) have any critical importance to her.</p>

<p><img src="http://jbuchbinder.com/images/2015/03/hoc-304-003.jpg" alt="003" /></p>

<p>The conversation continues, and we finally get a closer shot of Stamper; but he’s still mostly obscured by the shadows, finally occupying a larger part of the frame as his position becomes more important to Dunbar. He’s talking about how he’s been “out of the game” (on the <em>sidelines</em>) as he’s physically away from the center of the frame.</p>

<p><img src="http://jbuchbinder.com/images/2015/03/hoc-304-004.jpg" alt="004" /></p>

<p>The perspective is flipped, mid conversation, to show Stamper’s point of view. We can see that Dunbar is isolated, but of prime importance, occupying the center portion of the frame with all lines leading directly to her. It’s also fairly impersonal, as we can’t see her face.</p>

<p><img src="http://jbuchbinder.com/images/2015/03/hoc-304-005.jpg" alt="005" /></p>

<p>The monster (Stamper) approaches. His features are still mostly obscured, which is part of some of the horror/thriller idiom. (I actually left out a floor level shot of his feet, which also speaks to that.) We know that this is <em>not</em> a good person, even if we haven’t seen the previous seasons of <em>House of Cards</em>. He’s quite <em>literally</em> blocking the light and bringing darkness wherever he goes. As he draws closer, the reverse shot of her draws in.</p>

<p><img src="http://jbuchbinder.com/images/2015/03/hoc-304-006.jpg" alt="006" /></p>

<p>As he comes close to Dunbar, it should be noted that we never see their faces in the same shot. Continuing with the theme of darkness vs light, we see Stamper pass Dunbar in the hallway obscuring the frame, first from the left …</p>

<p><img src="http://jbuchbinder.com/images/2015/03/hoc-304-007.jpg" alt="007" /></p>

<p>… then completely obscuring Dunbar in darkness.</p>

<p><img src="http://jbuchbinder.com/images/2015/03/hoc-304-008.jpg" alt="008" /></p>

<p>When she finally emerges from his shadow, we see that the are represented as equals in frame size and position. He passes just as he mentions that they both “rub shoulders” with different people ; her with the leadership, he with those who work for them.</p>

<p><img src="http://jbuchbinder.com/images/2015/03/hoc-304-009.jpg" alt="009" /></p>

<p>At the end of the conversation, Stamper recedes into the background, losing immediate importance to the conversation, while our shot of Dunbar is only slightly wider than our original framing of her:</p>

<p><img src="http://jbuchbinder.com/images/2015/03/hoc-304-010.jpg" alt="010" /></p>

<p>Finally, Stamper gets into the elevator as a mechanical voice announces “Going down.” This seems to be a not-so-subtle inference about Stamper’s less-than-pure intentions, as well as a reference to the good/evil theme which we see in other parts of this episode.</p>

<p><img src="http://jbuchbinder.com/images/2015/03/hoc-304-011.jpg" alt="011" /></p>

<p>I might end up putting together a deconstruction on some of the other parts of this episode, but this scene is a good example of shot / reverse shot used in an effective, yet slightly unconventional, way.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote>
  <p>Life’s but a walking shadow, a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage, and then is heard no more. It is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. - <em>Macbeth</em>, Shakespeare</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We’ve become accustomed to viewing film, whether consciously or subconsciously, as a separate world with its own <a href="http://jbuchbinder.com/2015/02/26/film-epistemology/">intrinsic epistemology</a>. It represents a false world constructed within our own world – much like a play or other piece of narrative fiction.</p>

<p>Certain films exhibit a layering of realities – a “film within a film”, or “mise en abyme” – which can be used as a powerful narrative tool or as a metaphor for some larger concept. By interweaving stories within stories, a more complex tale can emerge which can be more intricate than the stories would be if told separately.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="stories-within-stories-flashbacks-and-narration">Stories within Stories: Flashbacks and Narration</h2>

<p>Layered stories don’t have to represent a separate reality or epistemology ; they can also be used as an expository tool. In Zemeckis’ <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109830/">Forrest Gump</a>, the vast majority of the story is told as a series of flashbacks – which we can view as being self-contained short films, even though they exist within the epistemological domain of the film. We believe the stories that we are being told are objective reality, even through the denouement, because we are given no reason to doubt the sincerity and authenticity of our venerable narrator at any point during the film.</p>

<p>The concept of “narrator as liar”, which I have explored, along with the layered story concept, in my original piece on <a href="http://jbuchbinder.com/2015/02/26/film-epistemology/">film epistemology</a>, shows that the concept of a sincere and authentic narrator can be subverted to use flashback sequences and narration as both a narrative tool <em>and</em> a plot device. The examples I had given included Verbal Kint in Singer’s <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114814/">The Usual Suspects</a> and the narrator in Fincher’s <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137523/">Fight Club</a>.</p>

<p>There is an additional aspect, along with a component of ambiguity present in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0144084/">American Psycho</a>, in that that Bateman’s “inner story” continues with the “narrator as liar” concept during the natural time-flow of the film, without resorting to flashback sequences to tell the ambiguous portions of the story. It should be noted that, while there are non-temporal flow portions of the story told through flashbacks, they are not a majority of the device used to tell the story. We’re treated to the ambiguity of a narrator who <em>doesn’t know that he is a liar</em>, much like the narrator in <em>Fight Club</em> – but <em>Fight Club</em> is told, almost entirely, as a series of flashback sequences.</p>

<p>Putting aside “narrator as liar” examples, however, shows that many Hollywood films rely heavily on flashback-style authentic exposition to tell their stories within their epistemological system; so much that we don’t view those flashbacks as a potentially separate epistemological system or inner story, but as an adjunct to the primary story. In this way, we are told stories within stories without them actually <em>being</em> a logically separate story.</p>

<h2 id="stories-within-stories-stages-films-and-an-inner-story">Stories within Stories: Stages, Films, and an Inner Story</h2>

<p>Inner stories can be represented by actual film, theater, or book productions or materials. In this way, the inner story can be physically separated from the outer story – even if some ambiguity is potentially introduced in the story about that separation.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://jbuchbinder.com/images/stills/sherlockjr11.jpg" width="300" height="200" title="'Keaton inhabiting the inner story in &#34;Sherlock Jr&#34;'" alt="'Keaton inhabiting the inner story in &#34;Sherlock Jr&#34;'" /></p>

<p>Keaton’s <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0015324/">Sherlock Jr</a> tells the majority of the narrative through the dream of the protagonist, who works as a film projectionist. This, by itself, isn’t anything special, but Keaton’s character walks through film audience present in the outer story, who are implicitly watching the inner story, and physically injects himself into the film by walking through the invisible “fourth wall” to be come a part of the inner story.</p>

<p>Weir’s <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120382/">The Truman Show</a> treats us to an unwitting participant in a television show, in what appears to be an allegory about man’s relationship to his creator as he discovers the true nature of his existence. Where it was a bit heavy-handed in some places (Harris’s character being named “Christof”, or the line “I am the creator … (pregnant pause) … of a television show”), the “real world” and outer story exist outside of the inner story while the denizens of the outer story are shown voyeuristically watching the predominant inner story as it slowly is shown to recede into the outer story as the metaphoric curtain is pulled back. Our protagonist <em>literally</em> bows before leaving the not-so-metaphoric stage, giving us a curtain call for the inner story moments before the outer story ends. There is also a certain implication that Truman is experiencing a widening of his perceptions and metaphorically (as well as physically) escaping the epistemological confinement in which he lived his entire life – quite possibly a not-so-subtle poke at religion.</p>

<p>I refer back to one of my favorite Gilliam films, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096764/">The Adventures of Baron Munchausen</a> for an example of an inner theatre-stage-set story, as well as to Iñárritu’s now critically-acclaimed <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2562232/">Birdman</a>. Both have an inner theater production which relates (to one degree or another) to the outer story. I’m not going to even <em>attempt</em> to do a better <a href="http://www.avclub.com/article/how-reality-becomes-function-film-technique-birdma-215503">technical analysis of the film</a> than SEK did, but I would like to note that both the inner stage play and the meta-discussion in the outer story regarding that inner play relate back to the outer plot and outer reality, even as the protagonist appears to be losing his grip on it. Theater has been used in other popular films, more recently <em>Moulin Rouge</em> and both versions of <em>To Be or Not To Be</em>, although it does not inherently contain the same implications about the nature of reality that <em>Munchausen</em> does; the concept of mise en abysme is, instead, used as a simple narrative device to drive the story forward.</p>

<p>As for a literature-based inner story, Goldman and Reiner’s <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093779/">The Princess Bride</a> qualifies as an example of an inner story told as an outer story narrator relating the contents of an outer story work of fiction containing the inner story. A far more nuanced example of this would be Kaufmann and Jonze’s <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0268126/">Adaptation</a> because it defies that simple categorization. Even though Hollywood films’ authors have become increasingly self-referential – possibly due to the old adage about writing “what you know” (which is, appropriately, lampshaded in <em>Adaptation</em> through Brian Cox’s character) – most of the stories are banal tales of narcissism and self indulgence, as the author almost invariably makes him or herself the infallible protagonist.</p>

<h2 id="ambiguity-between-inner-and-outer-story">Ambiguity Between Inner and Outer Story</h2>

<p>In <em>Adaptation</em>, Kaufmann’s inner story starts by intentionally confusing the real world with the outer story. This trend continues throughout the course of the film, and was so successful at confusing the intended epistemology that a <em>fictional character</em>, Kaufmann’s twin brother, received a joint writing award for the screenplay for <em>Adaptation</em>. He also creates an inner story as the screenplay adaptation for “The Orchid Thief” – which is a <em>real</em> book in our reality, and which serves as the <em>real world</em> source for the story material in <em>Adaptation</em>. The outer story is an adaptation of “The Orchid Thief”, but so is the inner story. It is a masterpiece of both ambiguous epistemic domains and an interesting viewpoint regarding the entire craft behind film adaptations.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Well, I really want to encourage a kind of fantasy, a kind of magic. I love the term magic realism, whoever invented it — I do actually like it because it says certain things. It’s about expanding how you see the world. I think we live in an age where we’re just hammered, hammered to think this is what the world is. Television’s saying, everything’s saying “That’s the world.” And it’s not the world. The world is a million possible things. - Terry Gilliam, <a href="http://www.believermag.com/issues/200303/?read=interview_gilliam">Salman Rushdie talks with Terry Gilliam</a> <sup>(<a href="http://www.webcitation.org/6WsvDrr34">cite</a>)</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would be doing any readers of this piece a serious disservice by failing to mention Terry Gilliam’s works in a piece regarding inner and outer story ambiguities. Most of his films have some sort of delusion, story, or narrative work which tries to transcend the barrier between imagination and reality – of inner story and outer story.</p>

<p><em>Munchausen</em> delivers this ambiguity through both filmmaking techniques, such as cross-cutting quickly between two conflicting layers of story (the bombing of the theater contrasted with the escape from the Sultan’s palace) or mixing sets in such a way to deliberately fuse the stories together (when the actor playing the Sultan is pushed out onto the stage for the reveal that he is now in the Sultan’s palace). The battle between imagination and reality is given a physical form, as well, through the characters of The Right Ordinary Horatio Jackson (Jonathan Pryce) and the Baron himself. In one of the inner stories, Jackson assassinates the Baron as he is being accepted and lauded by a world which had rejected him – but it is shown to be an inner story, and the Baron (imagination) is still able to outlive and outwit Jackson (reality).</p>

<p>A similar, yet different, scenario is set up in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114746/">Twelve Monkeys</a>. Cole has a recurring dream about seeing a man shot before he returns to the past – but is the “past” really the present, and his “present” (our future) really just a delusion? Gilliam spends a good portion of the film playing up the ambiguity of those two states against Cole’s fragile mental state. We’re given <em>some</em> sort of epistemic relief when Dr Railly finds pictures of Cole in a history book and identifies a bullet as being very old – but there’s never really any certainty, and the ambiguity can theoretically continue on. Cole’s “dream” is revealed in the final act to be his unknowing memory of his own death, completing his timeline in an out-of-sequence circle. Even though Cole is warned that he will be lost to the past (assuming that his “present” is actually reality) and told that history is immutable, he still tries to change it. We are all puppets in the grand scheme of history – from an anthropological point of view, this has already happened – but Cole can’t accept that he is not the master of his own destiny.</p>

<p>Another example of ambiguity between outer and inner story / film is Brooks’ <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071230/">Blazing Saddles</a>. Not only do the characters seem to be periodically aware that they are part of the outer film, occasionally using frontality to speak directly to the audience a la Groucho Marx, but the outer film <em>is</em> the inner film. Much as he did in <em>Spaceballs</em>, Brooks conflates the inner and outer films while making it clear that the characters are somewhat aware that they exist within a film. <em>Spaceballs</em> does this through both dialogue (“The ship’s too big; if I walk, the movie’ll be over.”) and through entire scenes (the “instant cassettes” scene). Although this is primarily played for laughs, it intrinsically changes our perceptions of the characters through our knowledge of their self-aware nature. <em>Blazing Saddles</em> not only juxtaposes the ending fight scene in Rock Ridge with the characters <em>literally</em> breaking the fourth wall into other sets, but has the characters simultaneously watching their film while other characters are, according to the in-universe continuity, still making that film. Continuity even carries over between the two layers, with Wilder holding his theater popcorn bucket in the scene after he is shown to be in a theater … watching the very film that he has yet to finish.</p>

<p>The last example I’d like to cite is the excellent <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0352520/">The Life and Death of Peter Sellers</a>. It follows an interwoven narrative, given with subjective exposition by the titular character, played expertly by the always-superb Geoffrey Rush. The story within story motif is clear as Sellers is shown intermittently to be playing <em>every character</em> whenever the thin curtain between the outer and inner material is pulled back. The titular character is so egotistical and full of himself that we are constantly reminded that we are seeing the world through <em>his</em> subjective gaze. We have to assume that what we are seeing somewhat resembles the objective truth, even though our narrator is a self-proclaimed liar, to one degree or another. Apart from Rush playing Sellers playing his characters as a function of narcissism, it functions as a film technique to point to Sellers’ lack of a solid sense of self or personality – much as the discontinuous editing technique of <em>Deconstructing Harry</em> points to the fractured way that its eponymous character views reality.</p>

<h2 id="reality-as-a-shared-delusion">Reality as a Shared Delusion</h2>

<p>Even though the Wachowskis’ <em>The Matrix</em> popularized this in film culture, the idea that reality as we know it is just a shared delusion has been around for a while. John Carpenter’s <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096256/">They Live</a> insinuated, more than ten years before <em>The Matrix</em>, that most people live in a shared delusion, unable to see the reality that exists around them. The inner story and the outer story share not only diagetic space, but also epistemological space. They live in the same world, even if the shared delusion of some make it appear to be a different world. The campy pastiche film <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086856/">The Adventures of Buckaroo Bonzai Across the 8th Dimension</a> (which predated <em>They Live</em> by four years) uses a similar separation between inner and outer story. It does use a different differentiation mechanism: a spark of energy rather than a pair of sunglasses.</p>

<p><em>The Matrix</em> physically separated the denizens of the shared delusion by embedding the inner story in the container of a computer simulation, which the outer story characters, once aware, could jump in and out of. It played very heavily off of the concept of awareness, in that some people in the inner story could jump to the outer story by having knowledge that they were essentially characters in a fiction. There are a lot of philosophical overtones present, and I’m sure others have done far more justice to analyzing them than I would have done.</p>

<p>Proyas’s <em>Dark City</em> is an interesting hybrid between the type of shared delusions in <em>They Live</em> and <em>The Matrix</em>. Like <em>They Live</em>, the characters experiencing the shared delusion of the inner story share the same space as the characters experiencing the outer story, and much like <em>The Matrix</em>, they are unwitting test subjects, whose gruesome reality is not apparent to them until they are willing to take a leap of faith, of sorts (the red pill/blue pill test in <em>The Matrix</em> and trying to find Shell Beach in <em>Dark City</em>). In <em>Dark City</em>, no one questions why there is never any sun, nor why they never have any desire to leave the city, nor why they only have dim, distant memories; they accept the reality with which they are presented.</p>

<p>Nolan’s <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/">Inception</a> not only has a inner story, but <em>three more</em> story layers beneath. One of the criticisms I’ve heard about <em>Inception</em> was that, due to the varying story layers, it was difficult to follow; I didn’t agree with that assessment, but felt compelled to include it here. Depending on whether or not you agree that the “real world” shown as the outer story layer is, indeed, the outer story layer or not, there may be an unseen layer between the further visible story layer and our reality. To further complicate matters, the characters are all meant to represent different functions of filmmakers – there is a “meta-meaning” on top of the already convoluted layered-reality story line. One of the most important epistemological constants in all of the realities is that the inhabitants of any of these stories are, much like the characters in most films, unaware that they are living in a story, or a story within a story, or a story within a story within …</p>

<p>Much like <em>Dark City</em>’s theme of the Strangers trying to steal our souls / humanity through our memories, Jeunet’s <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112682/">La cité des enfants perdus</a> centers around the theme of a mad scientist, Krank, trying to take youth / life from children by stealing their dreams. The film is rife with shared delusions and obsessions, from the clones’ attempt to prove which is “l’originale”, to Krank’s obsession with living through the dreams of others, to One’s need for family to live out his dystopian existence.</p>

<h2 id="why-does-this-technique-resonate-with-us">Why does this technique resonate with us?</h2>

<p>I don’t think I can put forth a concrete answer to that, mostly due to the way that eisegesis trumps exegesis in the majority of film viewers.</p>

<p>My working theory is that layered stories resonate because they tap into some subconscious desire for us to see this world as as dream – or at the very least, a part of a bigger, better world. To quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There’s an old joke - um… two elderly women are at a Catskill mountain resort, and one of ‘em says, “Boy, the food at this place is really terrible.” The other one says, “Yeah, I know; and such small portions.” Well, that’s essentially how I feel about life - full of loneliness, and misery, and suffering, and unhappiness, and it’s all over much too quickly.” - <em>Annie Hall</em>, Woody Allen</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This desire for more – of something – generally is accompanied with the idea that the something we seek is <em>better</em> than what we have here and now. Film is, to one extent or another, escapism. It could be argued that one of the pushes for epistemic closure in film stems from our desire not to let the comforting delusion of the film universe, which we love, abruptly end with a credit roll.</p>

<p>There are some films where the story breaks out of an inner world into an outer one, and the outer world is far more horrifying and bleak than the inner world. This subverts our desires for a better outer world, as exploited masterfully in Proyas’s <em>Dark City</em> and the Wachowskis’ <em>The Matrix</em>. It is also implied in <em>The Truman Show</em> that the outer world is a terrible place, by Christof.</p>

    <id>http://jbuchbinder.com/2015/03/06/film-epistemology-ii</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>This continues the analysis from my <a href="http://jbuchbinder.com/2015/02/26/film-epistemology/">previous article on epistemology in film</a>. It makes more sense in the context of the first part.</em></p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="known-unknowns-and-unknown-unknowns">Known unknowns and unknown unknowns</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns – the ones we don’t know we don’t know. And if one looks throughout the history of our country and other free countries, it is the latter category that tend to be the difficult ones. - Donald Rumsfeld</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m not a big fan of Donald Rumsfeld, but his attempt to weasel out of a bad PR situation by echoing the sentiments of Nassim Taleb’s “Fooled by Randomness” does have a silver lining of real value in epistemological evaluation – as well as in the analysis of the effects of intentionally incomplete epistemology on film viewing.</p>

<p>There are certain things that are going to fall outside the realm of narrative exposition – our “unknown unknowns”. These can manifest as plot twists, or may simply contain areas of knowledge which are tangential, to a certain degree, to our principal characters or plot.</p>

<p>The “known unknowns” are the principal fodder for epistemic expansion. For example, in the context of Nolan’s <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468569/">The Dark Knight</a>, we are treated to a series of false-lead backstories for the Joker, but we’re always aware that we have <em>no idea</em> where he comes from, or anything outside of the explicitly available information in the film epistemology.</p>

<p>The oddest quadrant of the known/unknown delineation is the “unknown known”. In the system of information that we <em>don’t know that we know</em>, there are plenty of subtle hints and pieces of subliminal information which we ingest during the course of viewing the first acts of a film before the potential payoff in the last act. We may not be conscious that we know these things until they are brought to our attention, and the information moves to become a “known known”.</p>

<h2 id="epistemology-as-part-of-a-larger-canon">Epistemology as part of a larger canon</h2>

<p>As part of a response to the first part of this analysis, a friend pointed me to an <a href="http://kotaku.com/why-people-get-so-worked-up-about-canon-1688856413">examination of how we view canon</a> <sup>(<a href="http://www.webcitation.org/6WrSMmtox">cite</a>)</sup>. There are a number of different aspects to the relationship between epistemology and canon.</p>

<p>A television series presents an interesting situation; it poses the question of how to deal with a single work, generally under the care of multiple auteurs, in the form of multiple directors over the course of a single season/series. In traditional multiple episode television works, the story arc writers function as primary auteurs, using a “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible_%28writing%29">bible</a>” to attempt to keep epistemic consistency across works. Deviances can (and have been) introduced when interpreted by individual episode directors.</p>

<p>With multi-medium canon, spanning graphic novels, television, film, et al, the potential problems maintaining a single definitive canon multiply. It’s difficult enough to maintain canon between films or television episodes in the same medium, but, as each storytelling medium has its own caveats and rules, there are differences in the way that information is conveyed – not to mention that the presence of multiple auteurs (specific to each medium) would provide a potentially corrupting influence on the epistemology specific to the canon.</p>

<p>An example of this could be seen to be the interactions between large canon works, such as some of the DC comics universe works (i.e. Batman, Superman) and the television and film adaptations of those same works.</p>

<h2 id="altering-canon----and-the-burden-of-appeasing-fandom">Altering canon – and the burden of appeasing fandom</h2>

<p>The auteurs involved in the adaptations will sometimes drastically alter canon – <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0279600/">Smallville</a> and Singer’s <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0348150/">Superman Returns</a> in the case of the Superman franchise, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3749900/">Gotham</a> and Burton’s <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096895/">Batman</a> as examples in the case of the Batman franchise. Some of these works override / ignore existing canon, while some of them provide prequel and sequel material; for the moment, the question I’d like to pose is “what does a prequel or sequel <em>owe</em> canonical epistemology?”</p>

<p>There are a few things which I believe should be taken into account when trying to determine the answer to that question.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Intent</strong>. What is the intention of the prequel/sequel? Putting aside the general overriding motive of monetary gain, motivations can generally be split between a primary financial motivation to profit off of the material or an intention to either “re-imagine” the canon (assuming that the auteur can produce a superior outcome) or augment the canon. A primarily financial motive will most likely result in the canonical epistemology being set aside for the sake of increasing or pleasing the target demographic.</li>
  <li><strong>Integrity</strong>. It seems as thought the vast majority of epistemic extension and exploration is done without much consideration for the impact on both the integrity and the closure of the film’s epistemology. Considerate works which are considering attaching themselves to existing epistemology of a larger canon should be considering these factors before altering the epistemology. Any addition to canonical epistemology changes both the perception of prior works and potentially their emotional impact in retrospect.</li>
</ul>

<p>Fandom have devoted time and/or money to a “franchise”, presumably because they identify or sympathize with something espoused in the larger canon. Because of this largely emotional attachment to the larger body of work, fandom can place a great emphasis on preserving the present state of canon and keeping the epistemology intact – or perhaps as close to the state in which they originally found it when they became attached to the canonical works. This temporal attachment goes toward explaining why, for example, fans of <a href="http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Doctor_Who">Doctor Who</a> generally tend to view the incarnation of the Doctor which was their first introduction to the series as the subjectively “best” incarnation of that character.</p>

<p>There is another possibility inherent in the relationship between fandom and epistemology, which is that the viewer will (almost obsessively) attempt to seek out any epistemic closure or extension which is offered to them. I posit that it is the result of a deep emotional attachment to the characters and situations present in the canon which cause the viewer to attempt to create the most vivid knowledge-set of the canon and attempt to achieve epistemic closure.</p>

<h2 id="expectations--the-burden-of-context">Expectations ; the burden of context</h2>

<p>The context in which we view the epistemic system of a film, or the subjective epistemology, is almost as important as the objective epistemology given by the subject film.</p>

<p>The emotional and subjective knowledge baggage we bring into a film don’t necessarily have to have been introduced by other works in a canon. They could have come from other films in the same genre, adaptations of written works with similar subject material, earlier attempts at adapting the source material from the film, or even subjective life experiences of the viewer.</p>

<h2 id="reboot----uncorrupting-the-epistemology">Reboot – uncorrupting the epistemology?</h2>

<p>Over time, epistemology of a canon can become corrupted, self-contradictory, or suffer an overall loss in quality. One of the accepted methods for uncorrupting the epistemology of a larger work has been the <em>reboot</em>, another is retroactive continuity, or “retconning”, which has been used extensively in graphic novel and comic works as well as <a href="https://matthewkirshenblatt.wordpress.com/2013/12/24/time-travel-and-retconning-revisionism-and-reconstructionism-in-doctor-who/">television and film</a> <sup>(<a href="http://www.webcitation.org/6WrTwHOTQ">cite</a>)</sup>. There are a number of different successful methodologies which have been used for epistemic resets through reboots:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Complete epistemic do-over</strong>. This involves a disregarding of the entire literal epistemology, perhaps keeping some of the more commonly regarded portions of the canon, most likely to appease the target demographic’s past connection with prior incarnations. Examples of this would include the multiple Batman series reboots (Burton, Nolan), as well as the recent Spiderman reboots.</li>
  <li><strong>Time Travel Adjustment</strong>. This is when a series simply invents a <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicRetcon">time-travel type retcon or reset</a> in order to change basic principals of the epistemology. This differs from complete epistemic reconfigurations because the original continuity and epistemology is respected and then explained away or altered through the use of a time-travel narrative device. Popular examples of this include Abrams’ <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0796366/">Star Trek</a> reboot, and the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1340138/">Terminator: Genisys</a> film. Zemeckis’s <a href="">Back to the Future</a> franchise worked almost entirely by turning this concept into a plot device – a concept mirrored by the recent <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3148266/">12 Monkeys</a> television series, but ironically not from its source material, the Gilliam <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114746/">Twelve Monkeys</a> film.</li>
  <li><strong>Hand Wave</strong>. Quite possibly the <em>laziest</em> form of epistemic reset. It generally involves simply ignoring certain aspects of previous epistemology in the canon or offering a glib explanation – usually prior films within a designated series. A general example of this would be the <em>Highlander</em> sequels, although it has also been part of a fairly well known <em>Doctor Who</em> trope for the majority of the run of the show.</li>
  <li><strong>Revisionist Adjustment</strong>. Adjusting portions of an already established epistemology for the purpose of correcting perceived mistakes or inadequacies. An example of this would be the introduction of Darth Vader as Luke Skywalker’s father in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080684/">Empire Strikes Back</a> after it was explained through explicit narrative exposition in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/">A New Hope</a> that Vader had <em>murdered</em> Luke’s father; it was <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">retconned</a> during <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086190/">Return of the Jedi</a> through a particularly clumsy dialogue-based hand wave. (This is only one of many, many examples of retroactive continuity in the Star Wars universe.)</li>

    <updated>2015-03-02T18:30:19-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://jbuchbinder.com/2015/03/02/narrative-exposition-in-film</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Narrative exposition</strong>, or simply <strong>exposition</strong>, is the insertion of important background information within a story; for example, information about the setting, characters’ back-stories, prior plot events, historical context, etc. (from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposition_%28narrative%29">Wikipedia</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Within the confines of the skeleton of a film work (the script), there are many ways to impart information which would not otherwise be assumed by the viewer or implied by the filmmaker. I posit that the way in which expository information is imparted to a viewer via the medium of film is as important <em>if not more important</em> than the information which is being imparted.</p>

<p>As with any other aspect of film as an art form and medium, there isn’t a single “correct” way of doing anything. There isn’t one particular correct framing which needs to be used for a shot, not only a single focal length lens or camera brand which would have to be used to get the only valid shot possible – and in much the same vein, there are many different more-or-less-equally-correct methods of imparting that information. I’d like to explore the mechanisms and caveats of each of them.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="objectivity-and-subjectivity">Objectivity and Subjectivity</h2>

<p>It’s an interesting concept – there is no real delineation between objectivity and subjectivity as far as narration goes, if we consider that any narration is part of the <a href="http://jbuchbinder.com/2015/02/26/film-epistemology/">artificially separate epistemic system of a film</a>, and therefore could have a level of objectivity or subjectivity within the confines of a certain character, but which presents the same objective face to the viewing audience as a whole (in that they all will see the same footage), which will be subjectively interpreted by each viewer (since even though they physically see the same footage, each person subjectively interprets what they see differently).</p>

<p>If we view the epistemology of the film as a system which we mentally “enter” during the course of film viewing, we can attempt to assign a level of subjectivity or objectivity <em>within those parameters</em> to determine how objective exposition appears to be <em>within that system</em>. This is the virtual vantage point which I will be using during the remainder of my analysis of different forms of exposition, so as not to overly confuse the concepts.</p>

<h2 id="narrative-exposition--through-narration">Narrative exposition … through narration</h2>

<p>One of the most popular methods for imparting information to the audience of a film (or other visual work) is by simply having either a character (through a monologue or soliloquy) tell the audience the pieces of the story or other details which the auteurs wish to impart, directly speak to the audience through a voiceover, or espouse the information through a conversation between characters – or even a character who exists <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrExposition">only to spout expository information</a>.</p>

<p>Out of all of these methodologies, I tend to look down on voiceover narration as the most egregious, because it comes across as an indicator of either laziness or over-complexity, as the auteurs did not believe that the information could be imparted in any way <em>other than essentially having the film universe speak through a disembodied voice directly to the viewer</em>, even if it comes by way of a character. (I make the distinction between a voiceover of a diary being written or read and this type of narration, simply because a diary-type voiceover would otherwise fall under being categorized as a soliloquy.)</p>

<h2 id="captioncrawl-exposition">Caption/crawl exposition</h2>

<p>Popularized in modern cinema by George Lucas’s Star Wars intro crawl but dating back to silent movie title cards, crawl exposition is more or less a written form of voiceover narration, presented in a slightly varied form. It could be argued that caption/crawl titles actually present a perceptually higher level of objectivity to the viewer, as they speak with an omniscient deity-like authority rather than speaking through an anonymous narrator or using a character as a puppet of sorts.</p>

<h2 id="mise-en-scne-exposition">Mise-en-scène exposition</h2>

<p>This is where my cinematography sensibilities come in. There are many methods of using the camera as a virtual narrator, and it is a very powerful tool to use, since the camera’s recorded mise-en-scène is the lens by which the viewer perceives the whole of the film universe. This gives the filmmaker great latitude in deciding how much or how little information can be imparted from the framing and composition alone, before the actors’ dialogue or motions are considered at all.</p>

<p>Some even consider the camera to be its own character, and though this is fairly specific to directors and cinematographers, being</p>

<p>In the interests of space and time, I’ll just briefly overview some of the more successful methods.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Frame Composition</strong>. I’ll refer to <a href="https://vimeo.com/118078262">Tony Zhou’s breakdown of Kurosawa’s The Bad Sleep Well</a> for a more in-depth analysis of how the way elements dance in and out of frame and are arranged <em>in a single shot</em> can tell us more about the characters than pages of dialogue or a flurry of quick cuts.</li>
  <li><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2011/01/fight-club.html">Frontality</a>. The way a character can be looking directly at the viewer (although, to be fair, we only <em>perceive</em> that they’re looking directly at us, and for the most part, the camera is taking the place of another character) can subconsciously impart a wealth of information. It allows us to put ourselves in the place of one of the characters, and the way we perceive them can shift.</li>
  <li><strong>Lighting</strong>. Even though particular film idioms like film noir are specifically known for using lighting for exposition, neo-noir films have brought this technique back into the mainstream. Using visual idioms like casting bars of shadow across a character’s face to indicate that they feel trapped or cornered, for example.</li>
  <li><strong>Objectivity/Subjectivity</strong> can be implied by the type of shot used, and even the level of stabilization employed. If we need to get into a character’s head to imply thought, many cinematographers have used dolly-in closeup shots to imply figuratively going into the character’s head (or in the case of the intro to <strong>Fight Club</strong>, literally coming out of it).</li>
  <li><strong>3D Forced Perspective</strong>. I don’t particularly like “3D” films, especially as they generally come off like large pop-up books to me, but the ability to force certain objects to be more apparent, and therefore more important, by using 3D manipulation is another fairly effective tool. If a sword appears to be a few inches from your nose in a movie theater, you’re going to be paying attention to it.</li>
  <li><strong>Montage theory</strong>. Exposition introduced through the process of editing is another method, more firmly in the realm of post-production – and iterated in most texts on the Soviet theory of montage – which allows the juxtaposition of images and sounds to imply certain narrative exposition or foreshadowing. Cutting to reaction shots can coerce the viewer into associating those reactions directly with the content of the prior shot. This form is quite prevalent in many visual mediums, including film, television, and graphic novels.</li>
</ul>

<p>These can be used in conjunction with one another, or, as in the case of De Palma’s <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117060/">Mission Impossible</a>, they can be used to deliver contradictory viewpoints. In <em>Mission Impossible</em>’s first reveal sequence, Voight’s character allows Cruise’s character to use dialogue to confirm his intended exposition – which is false – but De Palma shows a series of flashback sequences from slightly different angles, revealing the true nature of the exposition, even as Cruise’s voiceover contradicts it. Cruise is lying to Voight, but telling <em>us</em> the truth.</p>

<h2 id="holistic-exposition">Holistic exposition</h2>

<p>Holistic exposition is the dissemination of information through observed character movements, actions, and observed and inferred intents. An auteur can impart vast amounts of information through the situations and non-discrete expositional phrasing. (I make the distinction between “holistic exposition” and “mise-en-scène exposition”, even though the latter is a subset of the former, for the sake of dividing between camera-based exposition and all other types of holistic exposition.)</p>

<p>For example, if a character is lonely, the character does not have to state “I am lonely” for the viewer to understand the character’s loneliness. It is just as effective, if not more so, to allow situations to unfold where the character is allowed to <em>imply</em> that same loneliness by actions, or even in non-explicit dialogue.</p>

<p>There are a number of caveats to holistic exposition.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Intellectual Laziness</em>. There’s a certain percentage of any viewing demographic that does not want to have to <em>think</em> about how information is presented – they just want the characters to come out and say whatever they’re thinking.</li>
  <li><em>Ambiguity</em> can be introduced unintentionally if there is more than one potential cause or source for the holistic expositional element. Is the character picking up a knife because they’re scared, hungry, or angry?</li>
  <li><em>Actors</em> make or break this style of exposition. If the actors lack subtlety or under- (or over-) act their part, it can destroy carefully planned exposition.</li>
  <li><em>Planning</em>. It requires much more subtlety to reveal information through holistic means than to simply tell the viewer what you want them to know, which requires a greater level of planning from the writing on down to the director in the chain of auteurship.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="respecting-holistic-epistemology-or-only-tell-what-you-need-to-survive">Respecting holistic epistemology (or “Only tell what you need to survive”)</h2>

<p>Not everything has to be explicitly told or known for a story or universe to be complete. As I had mentioned in my first piece of film epistemology, epistemic closure isn’t a necessary thing; the lack of it can has the ability to change the perception of a film by the viewers.</p>

<p>It should be noted that some of the wave of independent filmmakers starting in the 1990s seemed to rely on over-telling stories by introducing potentially irrelevant information to the plot through over-loquacious characters who buried their narrative exposition in paragraphs of misleading dialogue. Kevin Smith and Quentin Tarantino are two examples of this school of narrative over-exposition, but there have been many who have attempted the same techniques with varying levels of success. (It takes a certain level of craft to create dialogue which works this way but does not come off as cloyingly banal or irritatingly uninteresting.)</p>

<h2 id="dark-city-an-exercise-in-comparison">“Dark City”, an exercise in comparison</h2>

<p>Alex Proyas’ gothic neo-noir/horror/sci-fi classic <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118929/">Dark City</a> offers a very apparent dichotomic illustration of the differences in narrative exposition choices. The theatrical cut begins with a paragraph of indulgent voice-over narration provided by Kiefer Sutherland’s character (spoilers, of course):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>First, there was darkness. Then came the Strangers. They were a race as old as time itself. They had mastered the ultimate technology – ability to alter physical reality by will alone. They called this ability “Tuning.” But they were dying. Their civilization was in decline, and so they abandoned their world, seeking a cure for their own mortality. Their endless journey brought them to a small, blue world… in the farthest corner of the galaxy. Our world. Here, they thought they had finally found… what they had been searching for. My name is Dr. Daniel Poe Schreber. I am just a man. I help the Strangers conduct their experiments. I have betrayed my own kind. <em>(courtesy of <a href="http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/d/dark-city-script-transcript-proyas.html">script-o-rama</a>)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The narration sets up the basics of the plot, and now the viewer knows far more than any of the principal characters other than <em>Dr. Shreber</em>. The other principals spend the majority (at least two thirds) of the film coming up to speed with this information, while we watch along – textbook objective viewing.</p>

<p>The director’s cut, however cuts out the narration entirely, as well as extending some scenes to add additional dialogue and action to help round out certain parts of the plot. The major change which this has on the perceptual quality of the film is that we don’t know what the characters know (unknown knowns), and we don’t know what the characters don’t know (unknown unknowns). This, at least in theory, gives us greater subjectivity in our relationship to the perceptions and situations of the principal characters. <em>We don’t even know the name for the villains until the third act.</em> It also creates the potential for a fair amount of confusion in the first act, as we don’t know <em>anything</em> outside of what we holistically learn – John Murdock wakes up in a bathtub near a corpse, and someone is chasing him.</p>

<p>I found that while viewing the director’s cut of Dark City, the “larger truth” (or the “bigger lie”, depending on your perception) behind the city seemed to come as more of a revelation. I say “seemed to come” as I’m incapable of watching a second version of the film in a totally objective light ; my context has been clouded by my previous viewings. For example, it’s less noticeable that there is never any sunlight, as the characters seem blissfully unaware of that detail.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’d like to take a brief look at film epistemology. In order for that to work, I’m going to be positing that for our purposes, each film is its own self-contained universe with its own rules and knowledge both known and unknown.</p>

<p><em>(As a disclaimer, I’m no Scott Eric Kaufmann; I’m not going to be using visual illustrations, and precious few (if any) citations. There are also bound to be spoilers of every variety, so if a film is mentioned, avert your gaze if you don’t want to learn important truths about its ending.)</em></p>

<h2 id="film-as-philosophy-and-self-contained-world">Film as philosophy and self contained world</h2>

<p>As I’ve just mentioned, a singular film can be seen as its own self-contained universe – a universe populated with rules and knowledge which are specific to that universe. Sometimes that world looks much like our own and shares many similar traits, sometimes it shares many visual similarities but a different history, and sometimes it bears little resemblance to the world and universe we know and try to understand.</p>

<p>The important similarity is that there’s a philosophical system underlying each of these film universes, built on the philosophies and mores of the auteurs of each film (writer, director, et al). Some popular films and film franchises have generated series of philosophical works – Star Wars, in particular, comes to mind – as well as compendiums of knowledge and in-universe canon of all varieties. Within the confines of these films, the epistemology has been grown in such a way as to allow a more immersive universe (according to the optimist), and/or wring more money from dedicated fans (according to the pessimist).</p>

<p>One of the things that has tended to irritate my own film sensibilities have been when films violate their own rules. Film is a suspension of disbelief, but there are certain rules explicitly or implicitly set out during the course of the film, which define the epistemology in which I have to be immersed while watching. A film shouldn’t violate its own rules, otherwise I end up setting aside my suspension of disbelief and become very aware that I’m watching a film.</p>

<p>To elaborate, I quote <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillingSuspensionOfDisbelief">TV Tropes’ excellent page on this</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Any creative endeavor, certainly any written creative endeavor, is only successful to the extent that the audience offers this willing suspension as they read, listen, or watch. It’s part of an unspoken contract: The writer provides the reader/viewer/player with a good story, and in return, they accept the reality of the story as presented, and accept that characters in the fictional universe act on their own accord.
An author’s work, in other words, does not have to be realistic, only believable and internally consistent (see <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAIsMagicA">Magic A Is Magic A</a>). When the author pushes an audience beyond what they’re willing to accept, the work fails in the eyes of that particular audience. As far as science fiction is concerned, viewers are usually willing to go along with <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnoBabble">creative explanations</a> which is why <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicsGoof">people don’t criticize your wormhole travel system</a> or <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">how a shrinking potion doesn’t violate the laws of matter conservation</a>, but even in the more fantastical genres, suspension of disbelief can be broken when a work breaks its own established laws or asks the audience to put up with too many things that come off as contrived.
A common way of putting this is “You can ask an audience to believe the impossible, but not the improbable.” For example, people will accept that <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt">the Grand Mage can teleport across the world</a>, or that <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthInSpace">the spaceship has technology that makes it completely invisible</a> without rendering its own sensors blind, but they won’t accept that the ferocious carnivore <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull">just happened to have a heart attack and die</a> right before it attacked the main character, or that <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHacking">the hacker guessed his enemy’s password on the first try just by typing random letters</a>, at least without <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">some prior detail justifying it</a> or one of the Rules listed below coming into play. What is in <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> impossible just has to be made the norm in the setting and kept consistent.</p>

<h2 id="epistemological-overlap-and-suspension-of-disbelief">Epistemological overlap and suspension of disbelief</h2>

<p>As much as there is a suspension of disbelief inherent in any viewing of film (it is, after all, a series of quickly presented still frames in an artificial viewing environment), we require a certain epistemological overlap with our own universe / reality.</p>

<p>There is a certain range of deviation from reality which is acceptable in the majority of film. I believe this is because film has to balance a sense of relatability, which is produced by overlapping epistemology with reality, with its own deviations and rules. If a film is <em>too close</em> to reality without matching it exactly, we end up encountering something similar to the “<a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Mori_Uncanny_Valley.svg">uncanny valley</a>”, where we become disenfranchised from the reality with which we are presented because it becomes very clear to us that it isn’t real, and suspension of disbelief falls apart.</p>

<p>I believe that resources like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/CinemaSins">CinemaSins</a> are a combination of relevance and irrelevance. In regards to that resource in particular, it shows irrelevance when it posits that film should obey all of the rules of the real world in most of its critiques, but shows relevance when it acknowledges a film’s epistemological separateness and shows how that film breaks its own rules.</p>

<h2 id="narrator-as-deity--narrator-as-liar">Narrator as deity / narrator as liar</h2>

<p>Many films employ an explicit narrator, whether by title scroll (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/">Star Wars: A New Hope</a>), voice-over (Princess Irulan and Paul Atreides’ voiceovers in David Lynch’s <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087182/">Dune</a>), by a narrator telling an inner story (Verbal Kint in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114814/">The Usual Suspects</a>), by physically narrating a written inner story (The Grandfather in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093779/">The Princess Bride</a>), or even a character’s internal soliloquy (the narrator in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137523/">Fight Club</a>). This is generally done to augment what could otherwise be clumsy and/or ineffectual exposition through other means in the film – or even to give a certain amount of backstory in order to produce enough in-universe knowledge to allow viewers to be sufficiently immersed in the universe which they are presented.</p>

<p>The narrator has a particular type of power and hold over the viewer ; they are the lens with which the fabricated universe of the film is viewed. Even though we are presented with visual and auditory information through picture and sound, the narrator is the <strong>voice of god</strong> (or at least some sort of prophetic voice, if we’re going with the religious metaphor) as far as this universe is concerned. But what if this omnipresent narrator isn’t telling the truth about this universe?</p>

<p>Two extremely visible cases of this occur in David Fincher’s “Fight Club” and Bryan Singer’s “The Usual Suspects”.</p>

<p>In “Fight Club”, we’re led down a paraprosdokian storyline by a nameless author, who not only tells us a story in his droning monotone, but also shows us his misadventures with a character we know as Tyler Durden. Only at the end of the second act do we learn that our author has been lying to us, much as he has been lying to himself. What we have seen as a fully realistic and discernibly physical part of this universe is a figment of the narrator’s imagination. We’re forced to change our view of this film universe as part of an unsettling experience which helps define a major part of the attraction to that film.</p>

<p>In “The Usual Suspects”, we confront a similar situation – except that the narrator (Verbal Kint) is very much aware that he’s misleading both us and Agent Kujan. Our realization comes right after the perceived climax of the film, as Verbal allows Agent Kujan to apparently convince both himself and the audience that the elusive Keyser Soze is really Dean Keaton. Mere moments later, Kujan comes to the realization at which we are meant to arrive ; he has been lied to. This is shocking to the audience because we implicitly trust the narrator to guide us to the truths of the film universe which he inhabits, yet he betrays us, breaking our knowledge of his universe. Even more troubling is that we’re not sure how much of the last few hours has been real (according to the film universe), and how much was made up by the narrator. A false world, inhabited by a virtual deity who hides the nature of that false world with yet another representation.</p>

<p>Yet another power that on-screen narration (in particular) has is that it can provide the film equivalent to the literary “aside” or footnote. Groucho Marx was known for pioneering this form of soliloquy, which came to be known colloquially as “breaking the fourth wall”. It allows the author to speak through his/her characters directly to the audience without the need for voiceover – but it shows the universe <em>stop</em> around the narrator. What they’re saying is so important that their universe <em>literally stops</em> so that you, the captive audience, can bear witness to it. In Woody Allen’s <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075686/">Annie Hall</a>, the narrator’s diatribe (aimed directly at the viewing audience, in spite of the people around him) appears to be breaking the fourth wall – but the subject of his anger is revealed to be able to actually <em>hear what he is saying</em>, in contravention of Groucho Marx’s tradition of film asides. Allen then proceeds to almost literally pull a rabbit out of a hat by magically pulling Marshall McLuhan seemingly out of thin air to make his point for him, then resumes his narrative aside. To Allen, the narrative aside is just another platform on which to base a joke, but it speaks to the unspoken acknowledgement that the narrator is aware at some level that he is part of a film universe; he just bends the rules a little.</p>

<h2 id="epistemic-closure-vs-incomplete-epistemology">Epistemic closure vs incomplete epistemology</h2>

<p>Another supposition I’d like to put forward is that epistemic closure in a film universe essentially eliminates a very specific source of tension. “Settling films” (films which leave the viewer with a feeling of completion) tend not to leave unanswered questions, and if it does leave unanswered questions, they’re generally fairly benign or immaterial to substantial portions of the central plot.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we can look at some of the films of Christopher Nolan as examples of intentionally incomplete epistemology. A number of his films employ missing information or information which can be interpreted in a number of different ways to provide differing conclusions or philosophies to his films.</p>

<p>“Inception”, for example, famously ends with a shot of a spinning top which either will or will not fall down to indicate whether the principal character is trapped within a never-ending dream. Depending on whether you believe that he is awake or asleep, it changes the interpretation of the ending. (Nolan had actually said that fixating on the top essentially missed the point of the ending, as Cobb is happy, which is the important part of the conclusion.)</p>

<p>“The Prestige” offers a number of events which can be interpreted in more than one way. The last shot shows a room full of water tanks full of dead clones – or does it? We see that because we <em>want</em> to see it; we want to believe in the magic of Tesla’s invention, no matter how horrifying the potential consequences. The narrator, being Angier for the expositional sequence about Tesla’s machine, may or may not be telling the truth – he is, after all, a magician who would hide his secrets from everyone including the invisible audience. If there is only one body, it could easily have been Angier’s double. We could puzzle over this at length, which gives us a sense of unsettling non-completion.</p>

<p>Perhaps in a “search for more money” (as a certain purveyor of The Schwartz had been known to say), prequels and origin stories for most major film universes have been veritably exploding into existence. <em>(For the sake of some form of brevity, I’m leaving out film reboots and re-imaginings.)</em> The question which should be asked about these expansions and attempts to bring about some form of epistemic closure should not be “is it good?” but rather “is it necessary or right?”</p>

<p>Sometimes prequel films end up completely destroying a venerable mythology (Star Wars Episodes 1-3), and sometimes prequel works add backstory which is more or less completely unnecessary for the comprehension of a character (the “Gotham” and “Hannibal” television series, for example). I posit that incomplete epistemology inherent in film universes provides a tension which underscores certain themes, and this tension and uncertainty dissolves as soon as every important mystery is taken away by subsequent works. You have to know when to explain and when not to explain.</p>

<h2 id="layered-realities-in-film">Layered realities in film</h2>

<p>A popular motif in film has been the story within a story – from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0015324/">Sherlock Jr</a>’s cameraman dreaming in the booth to Inception’s dreams within dreams, and many more in between. My supposition is that the popularity of this motif, which stems from sentiments like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All the world’s a stage, and all the men and women merely players - “As You Like It”, William Shakespeare</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are many transpositions of external epistemological ideas in non-“story within a story” contexts as well. Examples of this are films like David Lynch’s <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0166924/">Mulholland Drive</a>, which uses knowledge about the internal workings of Hollywood to inform and shape the story.</p>

<p>A combination of those methods for transposing epistemology into film are also possible; Inception not only has dreams within dreams, but also has characters who <a href="http://www.theawl.com/2010/07/the-key-to-inception-its-a-movie-about-making-movies">mirror the jobs of the people who make film</a>. David Mamet’s <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120202/">State and Main</a> tells a story-within-a-story (the film which is being made), but also pulls from the reality of filmmaking and Hollywood politics.</p>

<p>One of my favorite auteurs in the realm of mixing epistemologies and conflating fantasy with reality is Terry Gilliam. As an example, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096764/">The Adventures of Baron Munchausen</a> has a series of overlapping and interweaving stories within stories. The Baron’s life and adventures (which may be pure fantasy, and almost surely represent fantasy and imagination in the context of the larger story) are presented as a matter-of-fact stage play which is being used as a diversion from a larger, terrible reality. As the film progresses, we begin to descend into layers of transitions between what we believe is the “real world” of the film and stories-within-stories. The transitions between them are usually not the typical dream sequence transitions; one of the most genius transitions in the film occurs when the Baron begins narrating his own life, and the stage actor playing the Sultan is pushed out onto the stage, to discover that it is no longer the stage, but rather the Sultan’s palace. Gilliam doesn’t really want there to be a solid delineation between reality and imagination, and it shows. By the end of the film, we’re aware that (at least, within the confines of the film’s epistemology) some of the stories must have been somewhat real, but we don’t know which ones or how much of them. Gilliam denies us epistemological closure, and it does not detract from the film – quite the opposite – it defines the nature of the film.</p>

<h2 id="documentary-and-narrative-fallacies-and-truths">Documentary and narrative fallacies and truths</h2>

<p>Documentary filmmaking is another odd case ; it presents itself as a sort of objective narrative truth, whereas in reality documentarians rely on their own subjective narrative truths and fallacies to underscore themes which they believe to be present in reality. The power of documentary film comes from its ability to expose an external epistemology in the guise of objective observation. The majority of documentary films also possess the omnipresent narrator, using him/her as the lens with which to see the universe of the film – but that universe is <em>our</em> universe.</p>

<p>Rather than creating an artificial world and filling it with narrative and knowledge, documentarians use the real world as the substrate to build their own artificial world, but sell it back to us as being the “real world”. It’s much easier to consume documentary film works when we are aware that they are someone’s subjective view of reality, with all of the epistemological baggage that carries.</p>

<h2 id="the-big-lie">The Big Lie</h2>

<p>The Big Lie is that it’s all fake; documentaries and flights of fantasy alike.</p>

<p>We enter into an unspoken and unwritten agreement with the filmmakers to suspend our ability to differentiate the 24 still frames flying past our eyes as individual discrete images, and instead peek into another world with its own laws, knowledge, and history. We all know, somewhere inside us, that it’s all a Big Lie, but we agree to leave our sense of reality, suspend our disbelief, and share in a small piece of something unlike what we’re used to seeing.</p>

<p>The problems with ignoring the separate epistemology of a film is that it can limit our ability to enjoy that film by removing lingering doubts or questions, or possibly coming a little too close or far away from what we understand to be reasonable deviations from our own local experiences.</p>

    <id>http://jbuchbinder.com/2015/02/01/whom-do-you-root-for</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A friend’s son asked me which Superbowl team I would be rooting for during the big game – and I didn’t have a satisfactory answer for him. Team sports have always held a “<a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/10/16/five-case-studies-on-politicization/">red tribe/blue tribe</a>” quality to me, even from a fairly early age. A great deal of that has to do with how we become associated with team sports, among other concepts.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>There is a certain <a href="http://www.apa.org/monitor/apr04/beliefs.aspx">genetic component</a> in how certain concepts, particularly belief systems, are transmitted – but studies tend to indicate that our beliefs are, at least, initially drawn from the belief systems of our parents (see: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobo_doll_experiment">1960s Bobo Doll experiment</a>). This means that our initial viewpoints tend to stem from our parents, although it should be noted that some belief systems (when pushed too strongly by parents), result in children <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0007123413000033">rebelling against those same beliefs</a>.</p>

<p>Regardless of all of that, team sports is a bit too – arbitrary – in its fandom. A great deal of knowing which team you’re going to be rooting for is tied up in where you live in proximity to that team. The upshot of this is that if you had been born a hundred miles away from where you were born, there’s a very distinct chance that your favorite sports team would be different. It’s vaguely the same lottery present with religion – if you were born to a family of a different faith than your parents, there’s an overwhelming chance that you would follow that faith instead of whichever faith (or non-theist belief system) you have now. The same can be said for political ideology ; whether primarily by genetics or primarily by learned behavior, we tend to “inherit” these things from our parents (or other primary role models).</p>

<p>Tribes are artificial constructs meant to extend natural family bonds beyond those with close genetic similitude, and the notion is generally thought to predate the modern notion of the Nation-State. The internal workings of tribalism at a sociological level are constantly being challenged by anthropologists and sociologists, but we do have a number of fairly solid theories describing their operation, at the moment.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Patriotism is, fundamentally, a conviction that a particular country is the best in the world because you were born in it - George Bernard Shaw, 1893</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Patriotism is framed as being a larger, more structured version of team fandom – at least, in my supposition. If our fealty is simply based on luck of birth, how much stock should we put into it?</p>

<p>I’m going to round this out with a very simple observation: if it makes you happy (and isn’t hurting other people), there’s probably no reason why you shouldn’t be doing it. If sports fandom is your thing, by all means, don’t let my pseudo-analysis hinder you from enjoying the trials and tribulations of your favorite team. If not, I hope that this will, at least to some degree, help explain why others are so fascinated by their favorite tribe / team / nation.</p>

    <link href="http://jbuchbinder.com/2015/01/28/experts-vs-relativism/"/>
    <updated>2015-01-28T05:04:36-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://jbuchbinder.com/2015/01/28/experts-vs-relativism</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the larger search for guidance, justification, or confirmation, we tend to weigh different opinions – especially expert opinions – based on how they relate to our trust “weighting” of them, by association. That being said, there are two, drastically different, models of weighted opinions: experts, or everybody (which can be understood through the concept of “universal relativism”).</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="what-constitutes-an-expert----education-vs-experience">What constitutes an expert – education vs experience?</h2>

<p>Experts, with expert opinions, are the preferred mechanism of conferred knowledge in academia. Departing from the trappings of academia for a moment, it can also be asserted that extensive experience also can produce an expert. I personally prefer the latter to the former. Anecdotally, <a href="http://redlinedoc.com/">my father</a> (who is a physician, but not a GP), used to tell me that his functional medical knowledge came primarily from his internship and residency, rather than having been conferred during medical school.</p>

<p>I have referred to the self-taught school of learning as the “<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119217/">Good Will Hunting</a> school of education”, referencing the Will Hunting character’s iconic line about education:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You wasted $150,000 on an education you coulda got (sic) for $1.50 in late charges at the library.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The role of seasoned educators in higher education should not be undervalued, nor should all skill-sets or educational concepts be learned exclusively or primarily through experience rather than through a traditional learning environment.</p>

<p>A distinction could be said to be made between hard and soft sciences (and which was pointed out by my good friend and colleague Chris), in that soft sciences are generally predicated on observations and theories which are not primarily verifiable (for the most part). Hard sciences have the benefit of verifiable and reproducible results, which allow them to be absorbed without a particular mentor. Soft sciences rely heavily on particular ideologies which, although they can be absorbed strictly through self-guided research, lend themselves to educational institution ideologues and their inherent personal biases.</p>

<h2 id="why-almost-universal-relativism">Why “almost universal relativism”?</h2>

<p>Relativism, being the point of view that there is no absolute truth or validity, is generally framed around the idea of “moral relativism” – having to do with ethics. I use the phrase “universal relativism”, possibly incorrectly, to describe a more intellectual form of relativism; the idea that we all have equally valid opinions, with equal truth and validity behind them.</p>

<p>I personally abhor this point of view, because it’s pretty easily dismissed unless a purely metaphysical vantage point is taken. Put in a more easily digestible way: <strong>Universal relativism only works if the world is only seen as a construct of our individual imaginations and views.</strong> If something cannot be perceived, does that mean that it does not exist? Possibly, according to that particular mode of thinking.</p>

<p>As far as disproving the idea that all theories and vantage points have equal validity behind them, take the example of the makeup of <em>The Moon</em>. If someone had the view that it was made of green cheese, it would not, in any way, affect the actual makeup of the moon, nor would it possess the same absolute validity which could be assessed through observation and analysis of the physical evidence showing the actual makeup. That’s a simple, albeit silly, example of a viewpoint which is not as equally true or valid as another.</p>

<h2 id="dunning-kruger-effect">Dunning-Kruger Effect</h2>

<p>What sort of a write-up would this be if I didn’t at least mention the Dunning-Kruger Effect?</p>

<p>We’re bad at self-assessment. It’s a cognitive bias that has the backing of some <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=search.displayRecord&amp;id=3282CD93-C8F8-1D4B-0757-5027602AE6AC&amp;resultID=11&amp;page=1&amp;dbTab=pa&amp;search=true">scientific studies</a> to show that, to varying degrees, we tend to either under or over estimate our skill levels, as well as the skill levels of those around us. This would, predictably, create issues in identifying and trusting the opinions of those who would theoretically be more skilled than we are.</p>

<h2 id="why-we-cant-have-it-both-ways-a-paradox">Why we can’t have it both ways (a paradox)</h2>

<p>Universal relativism and a system of experts are mutually impossible. They simply cannot co-exist within a person’s framework for judging expertise. This can be logically broken down like this:</p>

<p>1) Relativism believes that everyone’s opinions and observations have equal weight.
2) A system of experts believes that certain people have acquired a superior skill set or knowledge base than those around them.
3) Opinions and observations hold the same essential position as learned skills and knowledge, using the patterns established by relativism. (The Dunning-Kruger Effect would indicate that those with a certain belief in their own knowledge and skill will tend to over-estimate them against other people.)
4) A hierarchy of expertise cannot, therefore, exist in a system where everyone’s opinions and truths are considered equally valid.</p>

<h2 id="confirmation-bias-or-why-we-want-to-have-it-both-ways">Confirmation bias, or why we want to have it both ways</h2>

<p>Another, potentially more insidious, bias is <strong>confirmation bias</strong>. It’s an innate tendency we all share to favor information which confirms our own opinions, truths, et cetera – and it’s one of the reasons why relativism (or, at least, some subsets of it) are exceptionally popular. It means that we’re always right, all the time. Even if someone else is actually right, we’re still right, because our own opinions and truths would hold the same value as theirs.</p>

<p>But wait – we also like appealing to experts. There’s a logical fallacy called <strong>appeal to authority</strong>, which involves using a position of expertise or authority to disprove or dismiss someone else’s opinions and truths. For this authority to exist, we have to sanction, in some small way, a system of experts. We will however tend to ignore them when they disagree with our conclusions.</p>

<p>Or, to pervert an old idiomatic proverb, we want to have our cake and eat it too.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>There has to be some take-away from all of this ; how else are we to learn if we’re so distinctly predisposed to be terrible at accepting new points of view, or even judging the validity of those hierarchies of experts out there?</p>

<p>I tend towards the idea of a repeatable, independently verifiable methodology – although, that tends to fall apart outside of the hard sciences.</p>

<p>I suppose that, if you’re driven to universal relativism, stay there. Don’t accept hierarchies of experts, and continue to assume that everyone’s opinions are equally valid. If you believe in hierarchies of experts, make sure you take a step back and attempt to objectively examine the schools of thinking of which you are an acolyte.</p>

<p>There isn’t an absolute truth for everything, and we’re not very good at being objective – but with a little bit of work, we can try to see a little more of the other sides of problems, and perhaps bring ourselves a little needed perspective.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is my workup on effective exposure practices for cinematography. It’s an attempt to provide a fairly effective set of practices for ensuring the best consistent image.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="why">Why</h2>

<p>To keep a consistent feel between shots (and overall), there are a few factors which should generally stay the same between shots:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>ISO Sensitivity</strong>. This generally should remain at the “native ISO” level of your camera’s sensor, which is the level at which the sensor exhibits the maximum amount of dynamic range (levels of difference in luma between lightest and darkest areas representable). I’ve been pretty good about shooting most of my footage at 400 ASA, which matches light levels used with the most common traditional film, but this may vary, depending on the camera body you’re using.</li>
  <li><strong>Shutter Speed</strong>. It’s an amateur mistake to unwittingly vary the shutter speed / exposure time between shots, because the way we perceive motion in film is very particular. The majority of film work tends to use a 180 degree “shutter angle”, which corresponds to <code>1 / 2 x fps</code> – which means that with a frame rate of 24 fps, your exposure time / shutter speed would be 1/48th of a second to correspond to a 180 degree shutter angle. (There are obviously exceptions to this basic rule, but it <em>tends</em> to be consistent within a scene.)</li>
  <li><strong>Aperture</strong>. This may not have to remain constant between shots, but you don’t want your aperture settings to be dictated by the amount of light available to you, alone. It’s better to be able to compose a shot artistically, then deal with the amount of light coming into your lens separately. Not to mention that far too many “independent film” cinematographers have gotten a reputation for jacking the aperture all the way open and leaving it there.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="zones-and-the-zone-system">Zones, and the Zone System</h2>

<p>This is an interesting working understanding of light, and how to properly expose, put together by <a href="http://www.anseladams.com/ansel-adams-information/">Ansel Adams</a> and Fred Archer. I’m not going to go into the specifics of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_System">Zone System</a>, but it is important to understand the basic concepts to properly understand the rest of this article.</p>

<h2 id="light-metering">Light metering</h2>

<p>I can’t recommend a traditional light meter enough. It’s completely worth the cost, and will save hours of wasted work and blown shots – and generally will tend to be superior, in terms of accuracy, to cellphone apps.</p>

<p>(My light meter is an old manual light meter, which my father gave to me – just showing that it’s not the bells and whistles, but rather the basics which are important to have.)</p>

<h2 id="nd-filters-vari-and-otherwise">ND filters (vari and otherwise)</h2>

<p>So, if you can’t adjust the ISO sensitivity or shutter speed, and shouldn’t be adjusting via the aperture, how do we control our exposure levels?</p>

<p>Enter the <strong>neutral density filter</strong>; sunglasses for your lens. Depending on your rig (and funding levels), you could either use a “vari ND filter” (which is essentially two circular polarizing filters, mounted in a single assembly), or a series of single ND filter sheets of varying ratings (which can be combined to form particular exposure reduction values). Most indie cinematographers tend not to have 4x4 filter slots, so it may be easier, with the notable exception of lens changes, to go with vari ND filters.</p>

<p>I highly recommend the <a href="http://amzn.to/1B6v40h">Tiffen 77VND filter</a> for vari ND work, assuming a 77mm filter thread – which is common amongst a fair amount of cine lenses. (If you’re working with Cooke primes or similar glass, you’re probably not going to be be worried about any of <em>my</em> recommendations, but you’d also probably have to spring for vari ND filters with a larger filter thread size.)</p>

<p>One caveat about ND filters – they have the potential for introducing slight color casts into the picture, which makes grey cards or other white/color balancing equipment even more necessary.</p>

<p>The trick with ND filters is using them to adjust for your Zone V reading, which means understanding how to reliably adjust them to cut down a certain number of stops of light. This is an entire set of tutorials, and another topic, which is best covered elsewhere.</p>

<h2 id="lighting-for-standard-exposure">Lighting for standard exposure</h2>

<p>Medium-to-light skinned people generally are supposed to be exposed for Zone VI (+1 EV), with darker skinned people exposed for Zone V (0 EV). Zone V is pretty easy to expose for, since it essentially means setting exposure for the metering value, but Zone VI needs to be exposed at +1 EV, which means that it should be twice as bright (or a full stop brighter) than the metering value. Exposing this way may leave certain things blown out or underexposed, based on your lighting setup, but it will produce “ideal” skin lighting for a standard well-balanced exposure.</p>

<h2 id="exposing-to-the-left-right-">Exposing to the left, right …</h2>

<p>ETTR maximizes dynamic range by exposing for highlights, and ETTL maximizes dynamic range by exposing for shadows. The former prevents blown highlights, and the latter prevents details from being lost in the shadows. If you decide to use one of these techniques, it should depend on which portions of your image you’re willing to lose details in.</p>

<p>ETTR is very popular, partly due to its ability to hide one of the primary deficiencies inherent in most DSLR and inexpensive digital sensors – the way that highlights immediately clip, rather than gradually rolling off (as they do with film and more expensive sensors).</p>

<p>There are some mitigating techniques which can be used to avoid over-exposure (blowing highlights). Some of the more common ones are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Gobos</strong> - A simple “go between”, which can be used to block light. This can be made of any opaque material, and only needs to be clamped or secured between the light source and the target object or person.</li>
  <li><strong>Scrims</strong> - A screen used to soften light. This can disperse a hard light source in to a softer one, and is secured much like a gobo. As it does not decrease the amount of light appreciably, but instead spreads it out, this may not be effective for heavy over-exposure.</li>
  <li><strong>ND Film</strong> - Windows can be covered with neutral density film, effectively reducing their light-transmitting capacity. This technique has been used with great effectiveness in a number of bigger budget productions, but can be a little pricey.</li>
  <li><strong>Fill light</strong> - Matched light temperature fill light or bounced fill light can be used to raise the overall exposure level, which will bring higher zones back to a more manageable level. The disadvantage with this technique is that digital sensors tend to like a certain amount of light level variance, or they may produce a seemingly “flat” image.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="variations">Variations</h2>

<p>These techniques are designed to try to produce the widest dynamic range possible for your camera, as well as the widest possible latitude in post-processing for retaining details and image quality. There are a number of circumstances where the “standard” way of doing things could be eschewed in favor of a particular dynamic or idiom. An example would be intentionally losing the background in black to hide a lack of depth or intentionally blowing highlights around an actor to produce an ethereal quality.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Much like other parts of cinematography, there’s no one right way to do things. You don’t <em>have</em> to maintain ISO, aperture, and shutter angle / exposure time – but it can help, depending on what you’re trying to accomplish.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

    <updated>2015-01-15T15:31:45-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://jbuchbinder.com/2015/01/15/the-fine-line-between-confidence-and-hubris</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been trying to make sense of two necessarily contrary positions in regard to skill, art, and aesthetics. This is something of which I’ve been trying to make sense for quite some time.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="aesthetics-technique-and-intent">Aesthetics, Technique, and Intent</h2>

<p>The fundamental balance of aesthetics in any art-form is, in my supposition, the balance between the personal sense and the general public sense. This is somewhat necessitated by a very strange mechanism – that of our inherent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect">inability to accurately self-assess</a> our own skills and works. I would secondarily posit that art is effectively a combination of <strong>technique</strong> (skill) and <strong>intent</strong>. (Some have additionally added <strong>context</strong> to that, but I’m going to put that aside as an adjunct of intent for now.)</p>

<p>Technique is teachable. Technique is learnable (depending on the amount of time put in, internal aptitudes, etc). Technique is something which, to one degree or another, is somewhat quantifiable. A great deal of education in the arts is devoted to attempting to teach classical techniques, if only for the sake of eventually learning which ones can be accepted and which ones can be disregarded.</p>

<p>Intent, on the other hand, is a really hairy beast. It is <strong>not</strong> able to be deterministically divined from a work in a vacuum. Even more frustrating is that it can be broken into <strong>perceived intent</strong> (how we internalize what we’ve seen, heard, and experienced), and <strong>original intent</strong> (how the artist actually originally intended the art to be consumed). But wait – the original intent can further be broken into <strong>original intent</strong> and <strong>revisionist intent</strong>, where the artist retro-fits an original intent onto a piece for one reason or another – even though it was not originally present in the design and execution phases. (My personal belief is that this is done primary for reasons dealing with popularity, but I don’t have any data to back this up.)</p>

<p>If art is a combination of these two things, how can art be “judged” by others if the original artist’s intent cannot be accurately determined? Should it be consumed and rated based on the perceived intent, which is completely subjective based on the person consuming it?</p>

<h2 id="coming-back-to-confidence-and-hubris">Coming back to Confidence and Hubris</h2>

<p>The next logical question in the context of this reading would be “what does this have to do with the difference between confidence and hubris?”</p>

<p>Confidence is somewhat necessary in the artistic process, as it helps shape the intent of the work. If we have no belief or confidence in what we are doing, it is very difficult to move forward with doing it.</p>

<p>Technique, however, requires a certain amount of humble nature to learn and master. If we believe that we have nothing else to learn, we stop learning. As the source material from Dunning-Kruger concludes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the miscalibration of the incompetent stems from an error about the self, whereas the miscalibration of the highly competent stems from an error about others</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, hubris is a base requirement for successful intent, as we need to believe that what we are doing has some sort of artistic merit, both to ourselves and for the external validation provided by others. We would need to be able to weather the concerns of others to forge our own artistic path.</p>

<p>But technique requires a humility which contradicts that hubris, for if we do not know our place in the grand spectrum of abilities, how can we ever hope to know when we can improve, or how to improve?</p>

<h2 id="societal-homogenization">Societal Homogenization</h2>

<p>To a degree, all artists who come in contact with other art or other artists will experience a level of homogenization of their work. The Millenial generation, replete with Instagram pictures, <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/doge">Doge-level memes</a>, and an inflated sense of self (unencumbered by a history of perceived failures) seem to experience this effect at a greater magnitude than seen before. I’m not sure if this is due to the replicating effect of social networking, an increased population size (similar to the compounding effect of scientific discoveries with larger populations), or some other ancillary effect with which I’m unfamiliar.</p>

<p>I mention societal homogenization of art-forms because it leads me to the next question…</p>

<h2 id="is-it-me-or-is-it-the-world">Is it me, or is it the world?</h2>

<p>The question that I ask is “Is it me, or is it the world?”</p>

<p>If my aesthetic is different than the vast popular aesthetic, am I wrong, or does society at large just have bad taste? I can’t answer that question. If aesthetics are the domain of popular opinion, I’m wrong, and confidence needs to be cut back in favor of humility and a level of homogenization. If original intent is the important part of the equation, I should be forging ahead, allowing confidence (and eventually hubris) to shape the end-products of artistic labor.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-you-do">What do you do?</h2>

<p>I’ve struggled with this – and due to the paradoxical nature of the problem, the only solution I can offer is to make the decision about how to proceed with your art based on <em>your</em> intent. If you’re trying to make a living from your art, primarily, go for the homogenization – you will see better returns from a more commercially viable product. If you’re trying to make “better art”, go your own way – either you will create something which will transcend you or you won’t, but at least you will have made art which is yours.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

    <id>http://jbuchbinder.com/2014/12/16/the-danger-of-the-shortcut-mentality</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In “<a href="http://jbuchbinder.com/2013/06/28/skill-in-the-age-of-instagram/">Skill in the Age of Instagram</a>”, I had opined about the lost value of skill sets, and how the modern approach to skills is to “approximate” them with shortcuts like Instagram, Autotune, and Photoshop.</p>

<p>Even though these tools offer the quickest and shortest “path” to the immediate goal, being your current project, they retard your potential growth by limiting your skills and knowledge about what you’re doing. If the pseudo-magic time-saving software is taken away (or encounters a limitation), how will you continue to be able to function without it?</p>

<h2 id="in-cinematography">In cinematography</h2>

<p>Cinematography is rife with this kind of intellectual laziness, as all creative fields have a tendency to be. A few of the places I’ve seen this have been:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Cameras</strong>. If you haven’t met a single cinematographer who has lamented that s/he is being held back by his/her rig, you haven’t gotten out very much. I call crap on that argument, mainly because of fine work like <a href="http://erbpfilm.com/film/upstreamcolor">Shane Carruth’s “Upstream Color”</a>. Learn to use what you’ve got, rather than pining for something better / different.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Color correction and grading</strong>. Virtually every amateur forum on color correction and grading is full of people asking where they can get a “one size fits all” <a href="http://nofilmschool.com/2011/05/what-is-a-look-up-table-lut-anyway">LUT</a> which will make their footage look “like Hollywood”. If there was such a thing, the entire industry of color grading specialists would just be wasting their time and skills. There’s even an “Instagram” of sorts for color grading – Magic Bullet Looks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Focus</strong>. I’m still surprised at the number of people who complain that cameras do not do the focusing work <em>for</em> them. (It’s easier to remind them that, much like other electronics, more expensive things have fewer bells and whistles – and autofocus is a terrible, terrible idea.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Lighting</strong>. As soon as low light cameras capable of cine work, like the A7s, came out, people came crawling out of the woodwork, happy that they no longer would have to worry about learning to light a scene. Putting aside the relative noisiness of the sensors, low light / no light <em>still</em> does not look like actual lit footage.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Falling into these thought pattern “traps” may seem easier at first, but following this “shortcut mentality” doesn’t may off in the long game.</p>

<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

<p>I’m not sure. I have previously said that I believed intellectual laziness or possibly a culture obsessed with instant gratification could be blamed for attempting to take the easy way out. Upon further observation, I cannot isolate a single cause behind the widespread acceptance of these tools and shortcuts, but I’ll iterate through possible causes.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Illusory superiority</strong>. We aren’t very good at figuring out how good or bad we are at something (the concept of illusory superiority contends that we usually overestimate our skill level, and the Dunning-Kruger effect also stipulates that we will eventually <em>under</em>-estimate our skill level, once we’ve gotten past a certain point). It’s one of the reasons why 90% of drivers believe that they’re in the top 10% of the skill curve – and also could help explain why using some of the aforementioned tools has become so prevalent. If we believe we’re in the top percentiles of a skill set, we’ll also believe that whatever we do (as part of our “process”) is, and must be, inherently correct. This can be seen by the inability of many Instagram filter users to understand why their tool is an “easy way out”.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Instant gratification</strong>. Our culture, especially the now-pervasive “<a href="http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2014/03/07/millennials-in-adulthood/">millenial generation</a>”, which has come into cultural power with a shorter-than-ever attention span and a lack of any understanding of their own skill levels, thanks to a society hell-bent on issuing participation awards to everyone.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Intellectual laziness</strong>. Increasingly, people seem to be less interested in <em>how</em> something works, and simply interested <em>that</em> it works.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>“Keeping up with the Joneses”</strong>. There is a look and feel “arms race”, which closely parallels the <a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/sep11/articles/loudness.htm">loudness war</a>, in that photographers and cinematographers are pressed to try to replicate the look and feel of their Instagrammified and Photoshopped brethren.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The social disease</strong>. No, not “the herp”; the disease of social networking. A seemingly endless desire for likes, “+1”s, shares, and every other type of social networking accolades, has been a driving force in recent years; “<a href="http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/cpb.2009.0003">self-status seeking</a>” is one of the primary goals of those who engage in social networking. In efforts to garner the esteem of “friends” and “contacts” on these social networks, users are adopting the lowest common denominator, in many cases, to attempt to appeal to the greatest number of followers.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="whats-the-solution">What’s the solution?</h2>

<p>This is where I’m at a bit of a loss. I’d like to believe that, given time, those who possess the requisite skills of the trade will advance, simply by virtue of having learned to ply their skills more effectively, and those who use “skill approximation” software will drop off, or will continue to produce mediocre or cookie-cutter output.</p>

<p>That being said, it didn’t happen that way with pitch-correction software. Musical artists no longer have to be able to sing in tune (although, you could point at musicians like Bob Dylan to say “they never had to be able to”, but I digress) to be able to rise to the top of the pop music charts, and photographers don’t have to be able to take a clean picture to be able to produce a cover image for a magazine. The exact opposite, in fact, is expected from professional photographers – knowledge of manipulation tools is <em>expected</em>, and some photographers are becoming well known through their Instagram-filtered images.</p>

<p><em>(As an aside, even though I do have an <a href="http://instagram.com/jbuchbinderphotos">Instagram account</a>, I do tag my photos with <strong>#nofilter</strong> and <strong>#noprocessing</strong> to indicate that I do not manipulate them, apart from the forced square ratio imposed by Instagram.)</em></p>

<p>I can only recommend the long road – and I’m going to end this post with a quote that, while it may seem to be a bit cliché, is perfectly apropos:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Two roads diverged in a wood, and I— /
I took the one less traveled by, /
And that has made all the difference.
- “The Road Not Taken”, Robert Frost</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is even more appropriate that the oft-misconstrued sentiment of Frost’s poem was to lament that he had chosen the more difficult route, not to celebrate that he had taken it.</p>

<p>So please, take the long road of learning and discovery, rather than looking for shortcuts ; you’ll be a better, more skilled person for having done so. Good luck!</p>

    <updated>2014-12-11T20:04:35-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://jbuchbinder.com/2014/12/11/the-importance-of-failure</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Failing is a terrible thing, we are taught. As a result of inherent cognitive biases and our own illusory superiority (look up the <a href="http://www.spring.org.uk/2012/06/the-dunning-kruger-effect-why-the-incompetent-dont-know-theyre-incompetent.php">Dunning-Kruger effect</a>, if you’re curious about this), we believe that we are right the majority of times, that we are more skilled than those around us, and that we have nothing of import to learn from not succeeding.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>I’m going to uncharacteristically detour into a quick anecdote. I was attending a film festival a little while ago, and had ended up talking to one of the festival’s organizers. She had asked me about how I got into film, and talked a little bit about some of her own projects. After a while, I mentioned how I learned more from my failures than I did from my successes. She stopped the line of conversion, and said that she didn’t, because she “always” succeeded.</p>

<p>There’s a lesson to be learned from her. If you never fail (or never allow yourself to be put in a situation when you fail, or never accept that you have failed), you aren’t going to be able to examine your process to figure out how you can improve. If we’re at the height of our skill set at the present moment, I view that assessment as a dismal failure; we should always expect that, given time and effort, we should continue to improve as time goes on.</p>

<p>I don’t necessarily <em>hate</em> everything I’ve done in past projects, but can instead view my previous work as evolutionary improvement. Every project I do should be the best work I’ve done <em>so far</em>, and if it isn’t, I should be taking steps to make sure that the next one is.</p>

<h2 id="understanding-failure-and-criticism">Understanding Failure and Criticism</h2>

<p>We do not accept criticism well – especially not as artists. Most of our work is, to some degree, very personal. We then view attacks on our work as attacks on some part of ourselves, and become much more defensive than we should be.</p>

<p><strong>Cognitive bias</strong> is a serious issue with us accepting criticism, or any differing points of view from our own. Without getting into too much detail about the mechanics of cognitive bias, it is important to emphasize the importance of recognizing that we all possess it, to one degree or another.</p>

<p><strong>High expectations</strong> tends to result in a feeling of having failed at a much deeper level than the project at hand. A very insightful person had written (about film festival contests, in particular) that you had to be committed to making the best thing you could, not winning. It may not sound like a lot of inherent difference, but stripping your expectations for a project can allow you to be much more free in your ability to execute that project.</p>

<p><strong>People who criticize or critique can help you.</strong> Every failure which is left without analysis is a missed opportunity. You cannot learn from your missteps and mistakes without looking at them with a critical eye. A third party with less vested interest in you and your project can give you the perspective you need to improve.</p>

<h2 id="post-mortem-analyses">Post Mortem Analyses</h2>

<p>I come from a pretty heavy information technology background, and one of the favorite “failure analysis” tools we tend to use after something breaks is something called a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmortem_documentation">post mortem</a>, which is short for “post mortem documentation”. It involves a rigorous process of analyzing key elements which were responsible for both successful and unsuccessful aspects of a project or event.</p>

<p>For example, I performed both a post mortem on our <a href="http://jbuchbinder.com/2014/05/07/48-hours-with-the-blackmagic-production-camera-4k/">2014 48 Hour Boston Festival project</a>, which documented some of the things I learned about working with a new camera body, as well as working under tight time constraints, and a post mortem on our <a href="http://jbuchbinder.com/2014/11/07/winning-a-48-hour-film-project/">2014 48 Hour Providence Horror Festival project</a>, which took home a number of awards, including “Best Film”. Even the analysis of our <strong>successful</strong> project found issues which needed to be addressed before our next project.</p>

<h2 id="your-worst-critic">Your Worst Critic</h2>

<p>… is you (or at least, it should be). You need to be the harshest critic you have.</p>

<p>The rationale I give for this is that you cannot rely on those intrinsically involved in either your professional or personal life, who all have some sort of stake in how well you do something, to be critical enough of what you do. If you can’t expect complete, harsh honesty from those around you – then <em>you</em> are going to have to try to be as harsh as possible with what you’re putting out.</p>

<p><em>(Yes, I’m aware that the younger generation has been indoctrinated, to a certain point, with the notion that everything they do is the best, most awesome, most <strong>EPIC</strong> thing that any human being has ever done – but if you want to succeed artistically, you’ve got to overcome that.)</em></p>

<h2 id="avoid-negativity">Avoid Negativity</h2>

<p>Failure doesn’t have to be a negative thing. Any experience from which we learn a valuable lesson or draw potential improvement from should not be a negative experience. Much like the rest of life, this isn’t the end product of what you’re capable of. It isn’t the last, greatest thing you do – unless, of course, you become disheartened and stop producing things.</p>

<p>Stay positive, learn from your successes <strong>and</strong> your failures – and good luck!</p>

    <id>http://jbuchbinder.com/2014/11/07/winning-a-48-hour-film-project</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My team, <a href="http://www.shootthemoonfilms.com/">Shoot the Moon Films</a>, won the
2014 Providence Horror Film Project’s “Best Picture” award, as well as scoring
a “Best Actor” award for <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3895408/">Nicholas Magrey</a>, a “Best Writing” award for
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5720821/">Natasha Darius</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3895408/">Nicholas Magrey</a>, and a “Best Sound Design” award for

<div class="embed-video-container"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/l4OQm1J0F0w "></iframe></div>

<p>I’m used to doing post-mortem analyses on failures, so this is a fairly
unusual task ; why did “The Carving” win against other films – especially
against some very strong contenders?</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="its-all-about-the-story">It’s all about the story.</h2>

<p>As usual, we didn’t base our story off of any pre-existing concepts, scripts,
etc. Although it is expressly forbidden in the rules of the 48 hour film
projects, it is common knowledge that many teams engage in this practice,
presumably because of the difficulty of producing a good screenplay in the
alloted time.</p>

<p>I’m always proud of our writers, and this was no exception. When you’re
writing a story which has to come out as a four to seven minute short, you
can’t write an over-complicated concept, or take a half hour concept and
cut it down to a few minutes of film. We had used a fairly complicated
concept for our last 48 hour effort, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3713362/">Desire</a>,
and it did not fare very well.</p>

<p>It helps to have writers who know basic tenets of writing, and there are
a ton of online courses, books, and general help to improve scripts. Without
the screenwriters, we would not have won.</p>

<h2 id="sound-is-important-too">Sound is important, too.</h2>

<p>We spend an inordinate amount of post production time on ADR-ing, Foley-ing,
and otherwise enjoying the hard work of our sound engineer, which resulted
in the best <strong>sounding</strong> audio track of any of the films in the festival.
(Don’t take my word for it – it won an award specifically for that.)</p>

<p>Your boom operator has to be paying attention, and your audio setup has to
be… something. Don’t rely on a single source of audio, either. We had an
issue with a cable which resulted in having to use on-camera audio for a
closeup shot. This wouldn’t have been possible without a backup.</p>

<p>(It’s worth noting that in editing, I ended up doing as much audio replacement
as I could before handing off to our sound engineer, to cut down on the
amount of time which he’d have to burn finding the nicest audio for a certain
take.)</p>

<h2 id="take-footage-of-only-what-you-need-to-survive">Take (footage of) only what you need to survive.</h2>

<p>Overly fancy cinematography, while fun to execute (and great for winning
Cinematography awards), is nothing if it doesn’t help propel your story
forward. If you’re trying desperately to find a way to put a quadcopter
shot into your film, you may have lost already.</p>

<p>I’m a huge fan of indulgent, long, complicated shots – but they have to
fit your idiom. If you’re making a four to seven minute long short, you
probably shouldn’t do things just for the sake of doing them. A quick
example was that I had originally planned a jib/crane shot for a particular
piece of exposition, but ended up going with a snorricam rigged shot
instead. The snorricam doesn’t add as much “value” to the end product, but
it told the story <em>better</em>.</p>

<h2 id="on-the-other-hand-think-about-your-video-quality-a-bit">On the other hand, think about your video quality a bit.</h2>

<p>If you’re shooting on a handicam, why? Entry level DSLRs are cheap and
easy to come by, and with the right set of eyes behind the camera, they
can produce great footage.</p>

<p>If you’re not color correcting or grading your footage, why? The walls
behind your characters shouldn’t be changing between shots unless you
intend for them to be doing so. White balancing doesn’t cost any money.</p>

<p>If you’re not lighting your footage, why? A guy with a decent eye and
a few clamp lights can add immeasurable depth and character to your
shots. I know that “low light cinematography” is making the rounds as
the new fad, but you’re not going to get the same type of picture. It
doesn’t cost much (or anything if you already have the equipment at
home), so what’s the harm?</p>

<h2 id="if-you-cant-do-something-find-someone-who-can">If you can’t do something, find someone who can.</h2>

<p>Unless you’re a one person shop, consider finding other people to handle
tasks – especially if they’re better at something than you are. Get
someone with a good eye to handle the cinematography, someone who can
write well to pen your piece, and people who are good with audio to handle
your post production.</p>

<h2 id="dont-try-to-win-try-to-put-out-the-best-film-you-can">Don’t try to win, try to put out the best film you can.</h2>

<p>This is advice I had received right before the 48 started, and it’s some
of the best I’ve had. Because we specifically tried to make the best film
we could make in 48 hours (within the constraints outlined by the 48), we
have a film for our own promotion and uses after the festival ended.</p>

<p>Good luck to you in all of your cinematographic adventures!</p>

    <id>http://jbuchbinder.com/2014/10/19/another-48-hours</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Almost six months after the Boston 48 Hour Film Festival, my team
(<a href="http://www.shootthemoonfilms.com/">Shoot the Moon Films</a>) is entering the
2014 <a href="http://www.48hourfilm.com/providence/horror/2014/">Providence 48 Hour Horror Festival</a>. Along
with seventeen other teams, we’re going to try to make a 4-7 minute
horror film in 48 hours.</p>

<p>This is pretty far out of my wheelhouse, as I haven’t made a practice of
making horror films, but my team and I are excited, and I’m going to keep
track of both our successes and our missteps here.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="day-one-preproduction-kickoff-and-writing">Day One: Preproduction, Kickoff, and Writing</h2>

<p>The one crazy moment I ended up having before everything got started was
the realization that I didn’t have enough space on the primary editing
workstation drive – and I ended up ameliorating that by purchasing another
drive down the road. Crisis averted, no hair lost.</p>

<p>I don’t like the roads around Providence, which proved to be a pain both
heading out to the kickoff event (horrific traffic and rubbernecking) as well
as on the way back (incorrect signage sending me to take a nasty U-turn in
Providence). As our producer couldn’t make the trip to the kickoff event,
I ended up taking his place.</p>

<p>After a two or three story jaunt up a staircase in a pretty non-descript
mill building in Pawtucket, I joined a group of mostly younger filmmakers,
eager to pick a category and get moving. As this was a “horror” themed
festival, we had a list of genres – and the writers had asked that I not
request one of the contingency genres, as they were more difficult to pull
off.</p>

<p>The guy standing behind me, after telling me how much he hated “Found Footage”
as a genre (which, by the way, I also loathe), ended up pulling that genre.
We ended up getting “Satanic/Demonic Possession”, and I messaged the
information back to the writers, so that they could get started on the
planning and writing process before I got back.</p>

<p>Both of the writers were coming from previous engagements, including one
who was starring in a theater production of “Frankenstein”, the other who
had costumed and was doing hair and prep work – but they still
managed to crank out the final version of a script before midnight. Everyone,
cast and crew, got sent copies.</p>

<p>From midnight until about 2:00 - 2:30 a.m., I wrote out a tentative shot list
and printed a huge piles of copies of the script. I got to sleep a little
before 3:00 a.m.</p>

<h2 id="day-two-production--shooting">Day Two: Production / Shooting</h2>

<p>At around 6:00 a.m., my wife and I got up, packed all of the equipment into
the car, and met the rest of the cast and crew at our shooting location at
7:00 a.m. We ended up having to scramble around to get all of the set
dressing components for the set, and got production underway around 10:30 -
11:00 a.m. Shooting with the BMPC4K camera made shooting, in most instances,
much faster since we could shoot in 4K and simply “punch in” for close up
shots without losing resolution. It was a neat trick which had been suggested
to me about two years ago by the director of “Chez Upshaw”, which a project
of mine had screened with at BIFF.</p>

<p>I got a chance to trot out a snorricam rig which hadn’t been used in almost
two years. It couldn’t handle the weight of the production camera, so we
were using a Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera with a modified Computar 12.5mm
f/1.3 lens stopped down to about f/4 to replace the GoPro Hero 2 we used to
use. The footage is nicely inter-cuttable with the Production Camera footage,
so I wouldn’t have to pull any rabbits out of hats in color grading.</p>

<p>We had a hard deadline for wrapping up principal photography of 5:30 p.m.,
since a number of actors and crew members had to make it back to the theater
for another performance of “Frankenstein” – including two of our actors,
our production designer <em>and</em> our makeup artist. We barely finished our last
take of our last outside shot as it started to rain heavily outside. No
equipment damaged, no shot missed.</p>

<p>We had to return props, and since my wife had taken the car, our producer
loaded up half of the equipment and my friend Chris helped me with the rest
of it, as well as helping me return some of our borrowed props. Another cup
of coffee later, and we were transferring about 280+ GB of footage off of the
two cameras and the boom rig.</p>

<p>One of the actors and the producer took turns sitting with me while I made
the bulk of the edits. We finished the rough cut at a little past 11:50 p.m.
The cast and crew members present watched the rough cut to confirm that there 
weren’t any glaring issues with the cut, then my wife and I went through all
of the audio to catalogue shot numbers and takes for easy sound replacement
referencing. I rendered out a reference copy for the musician doing the
scoring, uploaded it, and went to sleep before I passed out on my keyboard.</p>

<h2 id="day-three-post-production-and-making-the-deadline">Day Three: Post-production and Making the Deadline</h2>

<p>After a brief hour and a half or so of sleep, I ended up having to get up
to help my geriatric dog, who has periodic breathing issues. I got another
hour or so of sleep before my wife tossed me out of bed, and I stumbled down
the street to grab a cup of delicious Peruvian coffee to wake up. I’m pretty
sure my eyes weren’t open until half way back to the house.</p>

<p>From 6:30 a.m. until 10:30 a.m., I did the bulk of the sound replacement and
matching work as well as the coloring in Resolve. I dumped out an export for
Audition to take with me for ADR, and headed off to get the few lines that
we needed done.</p>

<p>Five actors met me over at our original shoot location, primarily so that my
dogs wouldn’t scuttle any of the takes. We wrapped sound collection around
1:30 p.m., and headed back to recomposite everything. I sent out the audio
to our audio engineer in Massachussetts, who recomposited everything together
and cleaned up some of our slightly dirtier boom audio, as well as leveling
out the speech. Final render time out of Premiere came right after that.</p>

<p>A last minute call to the hotline for the festival confirmed that we could
present HD 24 fps footage, rather than being limited to 30 fps footage (as
the website had indicated). A quick burn of a DVD and dropping footage on
a flash drive which felt <em>far</em> too large for the content we were putting on
it, and we were off to the races – so to speak.</p>

<p>We hauled the 45+ minute drive through Providence to the drop off point, and
were the first team in our group (the “B” group) to hand in our materials
40 minutes before the 7:30 p.m. drop-off deadline. Yahtzee!</p>

<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Have an on-site audio engineer to take care of ADR duties.</strong> It’s a
serious pain to have to color <em>and</em> handle re-recording.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Get the cleanest boom audio possible.</strong> Make sure your boom operator is
getting pristine audio, as close as possible to the source, and monitoring
the levels.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Make sure your audio is being catalogued on set.</strong> It was a serious time
waster to do this late at night, and put off coloring work until the next
day.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Make sure someone is arranging rides.</strong> If someone needs to shuttle crew
around, make sure it’s not one of your department heads.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Screen your graded footage a few times before finalizing.</strong> I’m really
guilty of this one, as I noticed a few places where I needed to brighten
the midtones a bit, or match the color of the grass in some exterior shots
a bit better.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Make sure to let everyone know how important they are.</strong> In a 48 hour
film festival, there are no “unimportant” people. Everyone is doing their
job, and without them, things wouldn’t come together properly. Our 1st AD
(who is, by trade, a stage manager) had never worked on a film set before
– but you’d never know it, since she brought her “A” game with her.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="special-thanks">Special Thanks</h2>

<p>I’d like to thank:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5720821/">Natasha Darius</a></strong> – My
wife, co-writer, and general driving force behind everything I do. We
wouldn’t have done the 48 if it wasn’t for her talented writing and
creative spark, her tenacity in keeping everyone moving in the right
direction, and her infectious optimism. She was costuming and doing
actor prep for “Frankenstein” during this weekend, which made
everything else she was able to do (including prop shopping,
organization, writing, et cetera) that much more impressive.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3895408/">Nick Magrey</a></strong> –
Although he overbooks <em>everything</em> and wears far too
many hats, nothing would get done without him. Co-writing, acting,
production designing, wardrobe supervising… the list goes on and
on. Not to mention that he did this during the closing weekend of
his leading role in “Frankenstein” at the Bradley Playhouse.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4840208/">Curtis Reid</a></strong> – I give
him a lot of crap about everything, but he’s the other half of the
organizational aspect of all of this, as well as running <strong>Shoot the
Moon Films</strong>. I like to tell people “you need to get a Curtis” when
they ask how I manage to get stuff done. I shouldn’t downplay his
acting, either – I just usually focus on all of his producing duties.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6562104/">Jon Demers</a></strong> – He kept me
awake, gopher’d the crap out of everything, drove me everywhere, 
<strong>and</strong> found time to act. Give that man a gold star.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6854892/">Hannah Viens</a></strong> – 1st AD 
extraordinaire. She made sure that we were getting everything done,
and that’s no small task.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6562109/">Chelle Wright</a></strong> – Even
though she’s been doing MUA duties with us for a while, this was her
acting debut. Thank you for not only putting in a great performance,
but also for making everyone look so good!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The Entire Verrill Clan</strong> – 
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5220888/">Elizabeth</a> was acting and doing
sound work, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6854893/">Patricia</a> was taking
still photos, and they were nice enough to lend their lovely home and
property to us to trash judiciously for filming.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4941340/">Maureen Vlaco</a></strong> – You have
one of the longest commutes to set, but you were cheery, helpful, and
even drove <em>back</em> for audio re-recording right before a funeral. You
brought that character to life – thank you!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6854891/">Keith Murphy</a></strong> – I’ve never
worked with a stunt/fight guy before, but he was fantastic, in addition
to lending a double-popped-collar performance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6562110/">Paul Magrey</a></strong> – Booming, as
well as helping with all sorts of other stuff on set. Awesome job!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6562108/">Brandi Demers</a></strong> – You’re my
right hand on set, and threw in a performance to boot, not to mention
the time you put in prepping props!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Our post-production crew</strong> – 
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6854894/">Aaron</a> and
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6476893/">Garett</a>, especially. You guys
added so much production value with the precious little time we gave
you to work, and your work <em>completely</em> speaks for itself.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="screening">Screening</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4131910/">The Carving</a> is premiering on

    <id>http://jbuchbinder.com/2014/09/19/ways-to-keep-your-work-from-appearing-cheap</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Okay; so you’ve got a DSLR, a RED, a Blackmagic Cinema Camera, a GoPro – what’s
next? The internet is littered with all sorts of tutorials aimed at trying to
reproduce the “Hollywood look”, but where to begin?</p>

<p>Over my time as a cinematographer, I’ve learned quite a bit about putting
together things that don’t look terrible. Unfortunately, I’ve learned most of
these through the painful process of trial and error. If there’s an item listed
in this article, I most likely ended up screwing up in that particular way at
one time or another.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p><em>A slight disclaimer: I’m a bit of a purist. I tend not to deal with
post-production effects except when absolutely necessary. I also <strong>hate</strong>
camera shake, especially intentionally induced camera shake.</em></p>

<p>With that out of the way…</p>

<h2 id="audiophilia-dont-skimp-on-sound">1) Audiophilia: don’t skimp on sound.</h2>

<p>If your sound is terrible, your work is going to be perceived as terrible. It
doesn’t matter how artistic your shots are, how talented your actors, or how
legendary your vision. Audiences (and critics) can forgive almost anything, but
they cannot forgive terrible sound.</p>

<p>Sound makes up half of your deliverable work, so logically you should be
spending half your time working on it, but most of the indie productions I’ve
seen tend to ignore it as much as possible. Don’t skimp on a sound engineer;
if you manage to find a really good one, do <strong>not</strong> let them go.</p>

<p>Don’t let just anyone operate your boom mic. Make sure they are actually
interested in doing it. They should preferably be listening to every take and
making sure that you have good, usable audio.</p>

<p>If you really need to, get an ADR and Foley engineer. Or learn how to do it
yourself – just make sure that you give sound a reasonable amount of
attention.</p>

<h2 id="spastic-squirrel-syndrome-dont-cut-movies-like-youve-never-seen-a-movie">2) Spastic squirrel syndrome: don’t cut movies like you’ve never seen a movie.</h2>

<p>Editing is the “directorial discretion of last resort”. You can make all sorts
of changes in editing, including changing the entire mood of your film.</p>

<p>Don’t cut it like you’ve never seen a movie before. I need to reiterate that.
<strong>Don’t cut it like you’ve never seen a movie before.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Consider continuity</strong>. If one of your characters has a bag of chips in his hand
one moment and doesn’t the next, it’s possible that your discontinuous method
of cutting is making a statement about the transient nature of existence or the
fragile mental state of your protagonist – but it’s far more likely that the
person in charge of continuity fell asleep at the switch.</p>

<p><strong>Don’t cut movies like music videos</strong>. A new trend has emerged where music
video directors are being promoted to full length feature direction.
Unfortunately, their attention-deficit style of cutting has become the norm
for every type of film, even non-action ones. If you can’t keep your
audience’s attention unless you cut every 1.5 seconds, you might need to
work on your script or actors.</p>

<p><strong>Respect the 180 degree and 15 degree rules</strong>. If you don’t know what they
are, read a few articles on the basic rules of editing.</p>

<p><strong>Respect the pacing</strong> … or at least <em>consider</em> the pacing. I’ve changed
pacing in editing, but the resulting pace has to be considered before you
finalize an edit.</p>

<p><strong>Too many cooks spoil the soup</strong>. Or in this case, the film. Have one, maybe
two people at most editing your film. Everyone is going to have a different
idea of where it should go or how it should be cut together – do <strong>NOT</strong>
allow a crowd of people to make editing decisions. Especially if they aren’t
editors. (Actors can be the worst, as they tend to be concerned with how they
look on film, rather than the overall aesthetic.)</p>

<h2 id="read-the-script-make-sure-you-really-want-to-make-this-script">3) Read the script. Make sure you really want to make this script.</h2>

<p>Not every script should be made into a film. Some scripts barely have enough
content or action to cover a 10 minute short, let alone a 120 minute feature
film. Some scripts are just horribly written.</p>

<p>Think of the standard distribution curve; going by that, most scripts are
mediocre, some are terrible, some are good. You’re going to need to reject the
majority of material with which you are presented if you’re only going to make
the best scripts into films.</p>

<p>Find an uninterested party (not your close friends, family, or actors who would
be potentially involved in the production of it) and describe the plot. If it
doesn’t interest them, there’s a very good chance that you may not have a wider
audience appeal than your group of friends and family.</p>

<p>I should point out, at this part of this article, that not everyone makes films
for mass audience appeal. If you don’t, don’t worry about it. Find someone who
specializes in the niche you’re targeting, and ask them for their opinion. It
could save you quite a few weeks/months/years on a real turkey of a project.</p>

<h2 id="good-actors-are-not-easy-to-come-by-make-sure-you-find-them">4) Good actors are not easy to come by. Make sure you find them.</h2>

<p>Actors’ skill levels also follow the standard distribution curve. Be picky about
working with them, if at all possible.</p>

<p>Actors have the very unique ability to completely ruin a scene if even one of
them is out of character or “off their game”. Even non-speaking background roles
can break the illusion that is your film, so try to be selective in choosing
actors. Unless you need a character with a flat affect, don’t use an actor who
can’t produce anything other than that affect.</p>

<p>Make sure your actors get a chance to run their lines together and “block”
scenes before the day when their scenes are shot. Most actors tend to produce
better group dynamics when they’ve had a chance to prepare their material
(which is one of the reasons why the \ater actors prepare so far in advance and
practice together).</p>

<p>Speaking of theater actors – they’re a great source for acting talent. Most
communities have community theaters, and they are usually stocked with a wide
variety of talented characters actors. There are some differences between film
and theater work, but their “acting chops” are worth the extra work that needs
to be put in.</p>

<h2 id="do-not-rely-on-inserts-for-the-bulk-of-your-movie">5) Do not rely on inserts for the bulk of your movie.</h2>

<p>There’s nothing wrong with insert shots; they tend to add a bit of spice and
variety, as well as giving your editor something to cut away to if there’s some
continuity issue between takes.</p>

<p>Do <strong>not</strong> rely on them for a majority of your film. They tend not to tell much
of a story, and overuse not only gives a feeling of claustrophobia, but is one
of the telltale signs of low-budget indie films.</p>

<p>Like many other suggestions I’ve made here, this isn’t an ironclad rule. There
are many art films which make extensive use of insert shots to tell a story in
a particular way.</p>

<h2 id="there-is-a-setting-on-your-lenses-other-than-wide-open">6) There is a setting on your lenses other than “wide open”.</h2>

<p>Ever since “bokeh” made its first appearance in the photographer/cinematographer
lexicon, there has been a proliferation of extensively thin DOF shots. These can
be used to great artistic effect, and can produce beautiful images – but, much
like other tools in a cinematographer’s toolbox, it shouldn’t be the only tool
you use. All of your characters should generally be in focus when they’re having
a conversation in most circumstances. Constantly focus-pulling between two
characters because you have a tissue-thin DOF tends to give off the impression
that you have no lighting budget, or that you don’t know how to use your lenses.</p>

<p>On top of all of that, most lower-cost lenses tend to not be as sharp as higher
grade lenses when they’re used wide-open. If you’re a fan of cheap Rokinon /
Samyang glass, it performs quite well – but not necessarily across the entire
frame wide open. Stopped down to f/4, it compares favorably with high-end Zeiss
and Canon glass, so if you can stop it down a bit further, you’ll get a better
quality image.</p>

<h2 id="time-theres-never-enough-of-it-corollary-the-enemy-of-the-good-is-the-perfect">7) Time: There’s never enough of it. Corollary: The enemy of the good is the perfect.</h2>

<p>There seems to be an inverse relationship between location availability and the
time consuming nature of the shots in a scene. I have tended to find that when
I spend more time setting up a shot, I will get better results than when I
“run and gun” the shots in a scene. (Like every other concept, this has
exceptions.)</p>

<p>Try to make sure you’ve metered and scouted your location properly before
placing actors in front of the camera. You’ll avoid a lot of time-wasting
adjustment and blown takes, which will translated into better looking shots and
a better end product.</p>

<p>As far as “the enemy of the good is the perfect”: it is rarely going to be
perfect. Deciding how much time to spend on that one insert may be the thing
which keeps you from rushing through the rest of your limited time at a
location. This is as much about time management as anything.</p>

<h2 id="prepare">8) Prepare.</h2>

<p>I’ve joked that my pre-production time on a film is longer than the actual
filming time. For the most part, this is actually the case.</p>

<p>Walking onto a set with no idea of what you’re going to do or how you’re going
to do it will lead to amateur errors, rushing, and a poor end product.
Preparation, be it storyboarding, notes, location scouting, or anything else,
is going to save you from some of the easy pitfalls which produce a cheap
end product.</p>

<h2 id="listen">9) Listen.</h2>

<p>You’re one person in (presumably) a fair sized crew of people. If you’re
directing something, you’re the decision maker. You’re the one who has to decide
how something is to be done and who is going to do it, or at least delegate that
to someone else.</p>

<p>If you’re a cinematographer/DP, you’re responsible for the visual aspect of the
film. You have to make the decisions as to how the cameras are set, or at least
delegate that authority.</p>

<p>That doesn’t mean that you can’t listen to other people. Some of my favorite
shots have come from suggestions I’ve gotten from other people. The ability to
look past your own hubris and take suggestions under consideration from other
people can open up your ability to shoot or direct better – and that shines
through in the final product.</p>

<h2 id="do-not-assume-you-can-fix-it-in-post">10) Do not assume you can “fix it in post”.</h2>

<p>“Fix it in post” has been a joke amongst my crew, since I’m not a big fan of
the filmmaking ethos centered around correcting everything in editing and
post production.</p>

<p>(I’m shooting with a rig which requires a fair amount of post production to
bring the footage to its final form, and to be clear, I don’t dislike or
hate post production. I dislike the idea of relying on it for things which you
could have done on set.)</p>

<p>Blood effects are a great example. Any monkey with a licensed (or unlicensed)
copy of After Effects can make a blood spatter effect, but it’ll look like a
low budget horror movie. If you’re going to do blood, do it with practical
effects. Squibs aren’t difficult to design, even on virtually no budget. People
have made them with such inventive materials as
<a href="http://www.refocusedmedia.com/how-to-make-diy-squibs/">condoms and fishing line</a>.
Just because we’ve entered an age of digital cinematography doesn’t mean we have
to throw out practical effects.</p>

<h2 id="one-more-for-safety">11) “One more for safety.”</h2>

<p>My cast and crew have been so used to me saying this phrase that they gave me
an etched mug with it on the side. No matter how well you think you’ve gotten a
scene on film, there’s always a chance that you’re missing something. There is
no worse feeling in editing than when you realize that you’re missing something
in one of your takes and have <strong>no fall back</strong>.</p>

<p>Take the extra few minutes and get another take of that “perfect take”. You’d
be surprised at how often you can avoid embarrassing cuts and amateur looking
transitions.</p>

<h2 id="context-understand-when-youre-doing-something-just-for-the-sake-of-doing-it">12) Context: understand when you’re doing something just for the sake of doing it.</h2>

<p>“Quadracopter” is a latin word which means “I need to wow my financial
backers”. Well, not really, but it could be, judging from the way they’re used.</p>

<p>Just because you have a certain rig or piece of equipment does not mean that
you should necessarily use it for everything you do. If you’re adding a shot
specifically to impress people instead of telling a story, your film is going
to suffer.</p>

<p>Sometimes you need a crane shot. Sometimes you need an overhead shot. Sometimes
you need a snorricam shot. There are plenty of things you <strong>can</strong> do, but your
job as a filmmaker is to be able to determine <strong>when</strong> you should.</p>

<p>Film is about emotional connection and content. If you have a hollow work with
a lot of style, you’ll impress a certain crowd, but it’ll be devoid of any sort
of deeper meaning. Stick with your artistic integrity for as long as you can –
you can always make money, but once you’ve sold out your integrity, you don’t
get it back.</p>

<h2 id="equipment-hubris-never-assume-your-equipment-will-save-you-or-make-you-better">13) Equipment hubris: never assume your equipment will save you or make you better.</h2>

<p>The most important piece of equipment you have as a cinematographer is your
eyes; everything else is much, much less important. I’ve seen films shot on
RED EPIC bodies which look like a high-schooler shot them, and films shot on
DSLRs which rival anything out of Hollywood.</p>

<p>Never assume that a new equipment purchase will make you a better
cinematographer. The only thing that will do that is <strong>time</strong>.</p>

<p>“Equipment hubris”, as I call it, leads to bad and amateur shots. If you just
received a new rig, make sure to log some hours using it before you bring it
on set. Screwing up a basic setting on a camera is a very easy way to destroy
an entire day’s worth of filming … or more.</p>

<h2 id="the-low-light-disease-or-why-i-learned-to-light-and-stopped-hating-my-work">14) The low-light disease, or why I learned to light and stopped hating my work.</h2>

<p>With the rise of the Sony A7 series, with ISO sensitivities of 100k+, and other
low-light and no-light cameras, we’ve also seen the rise of the no-lighting
production.</p>

<p>Hollywood lights the hell out of their films. Despite certain films trying to
portray a low-budget look, you can bet that they have a tractor-trailer full of
lights and lighting modifiers making each shot look good.</p>

<p>Stop assuming that you need speed boosters, faster lenses, and tricks to shoot
with less light. In all but a few cases, you need to add more light, not make
your camera accept more light – and that’ll take away the “cheap” quality
which comes from not using enough light. ETTR is the way to go – as long as
you don’t blow your highlights, you can always decrease the amount of light in
coloring/post-production, if you’ve taken that into account ahead of time.</p>

<h2 id="coloring--color-grading">15) Coloring / color grading.</h2>

<p>Coloring / color grading used to be referred to as “color correction”, but now
that so much more is done with it, “coloring” or “color grading” works as well
as anything else.</p>

<p>Hollywood films go through a round of color grading with people who spend their
professional lives doing it. You can’t just “apply a LUT” or “apply a curve” to
something and have it magically look like a million dollars, any more than an
Instagram filter can make a picture look better instead of just making it look
like it was taken with a terrible camera from the 1970s.</p>

<p>Color grading / coloring is a time-consuming, iterative process. It’s awful to
do, but it’s a necessary evil. It allows you to correct lighting problems
(assuming that your base footage has enough latitude to withstand the
corrections, of course), change color temperature, punch certain colors, and
even correct moving objects or flaws in the camera. It also allows a final
look and feel to be given to your project, which can help take away that indie
low-budget feel to your film.</p>

<p>Color grading / coloring won’t <em>save</em> a terrible film, but it can take a good
film and give it a look and feel which will keep it from being dismissed as
looking amateur.</p>

<h2 id="framing-stop-cutting-off-peoples-heads">16) Framing: stop cutting off peoples’ heads.</h2>

<p>One of the things that immediately jumps out at me about low-budget film
projects, and cheap cinematography in general, is framing. If you’re not paying
attention to the framing of your subject material, the edge of the frame becomes
a knife which slices at your subjects and surroundings.</p>

<p>If you’re going to use a special aspect ratio / crop bars, make sure that you’re
framing according to those bars. I had a project on which I had DP’d where the
decision to adjust aspect ratio was made <strong>after</strong> principal photography had
concluded. This left a bunch of shots where the actors looked decapitated.
These are all things to consider before you choose your focal length, camera
position, et cetera.</p>

<h2 id="dont-ask-for-money-unless-you-really-really-need-it">17) Don’t ask for money unless you really, really need it.</h2>

<p>This is more of a personal pet-peeve. Pay your crew if that’s your
arrangement. If you’re paying one actor, you pay them all. If you’re doing a
senior thesis project, or a festival piece, or something else which isn’t
slated for distribution, please do <strong>NOT</strong> go on kickstarter, gofundme, or any
of the other funding/begging sites to ask for 10-50k$ of money. If you end up
with a chunk of bad publicity and unhappy financial backers, it’s going to
reflect poorly on your film.</p>

<p>(I’m aware that this isn’t a “look and feel” thing, but permit me my slight
digression from the topic at hand; I feel that it is important enough to
mention.)</p>

    <id>http://jbuchbinder.com/2014/08/14/modifying-computar-12-dot-5mm-c-mount-lens-for-m4-slash-3</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For whatever reason, there seems to be a serious dearth of information
regarding lens modification on the C-mount Computar 12.5mm f/1.3 lens. I am
going to share my experience modifying this lens, in the hope that it will
prevent other people from having the same issues which I have encountered.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>As a quick disclaimer, you really should not blame me if you break your lens,
or if it eats your children or animals. This either will or will not work for
you. You have been warned.</p>

<p>You will need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>File or dremel</li>
  <li>Very small screwdriver (flathead)</li>
  <li>C-mount to M4/3 adapter (I used the Fotoasy one)</li>
</ul>

<p>1) <strong>File down the edges of the back mount a little.</strong> I do not think that I
   can stress “a little” enough. If you file this down too much, you will run
   into the same issue I ran into, and will break the back metal piece of
   your lens. I used a triangular file and edged it down to a nice smooth
   surface.</p>

<p>2) <strong>Unscrew the three screws at the base.</strong> This will remove the metal
   back of the lens.</p>

<p>3) <strong>Loosen the center column of the lens.</strong> You will see a small lens
   assembly protruding from the back of the rest of the lens. Loosen it a
   few turns. This is a trial-and-error thing, so be patient.</p>

<p>4) <strong>Reattach the backing with the screws.</strong> The lens assembly should be
   protruding further from the back of the C-mount to M4/3 adapter, when
   attached.</p>

<p>5) <strong>Attempt infinity focus.</strong> Attach to the camera, attempt focus.</p>

<p>If infinity focus is not attainable by step 5, repeat steps 2-5 until it is.</p>

<p>If you end up breaking or cracking the rear C-mount, you can permanently attach the lens to your C-mount to M4/3 adapter using some solder or hot-glue.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

    <link href="http://jbuchbinder.com/2014/06/10/diy-7-dollars-film-slate/"/>
    <updated>2014-06-10T15:50:07-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://jbuchbinder.com/2014/06/10/diy-7-dollars-film-slate</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I can’t claim credit for this one – my extremely talented and resourceful
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3895408/">production designer</a> got the idea to
use an inexpensive slate “prop” and modify it slightly to allow the use of
erasable whiteboard markers. These are usually a bit more than seven dollars,
and we didn’t have the time to wait for one to arrive in the mail for the
shoot in question.</p>

<p>There are only two pieces of “hardware” which are required to make this,
along with a few pieces of duct tape, a sharpie, a ruler, and whatever 
whiteboard markers and erasers you are planning to use on the finished
slate.</p>

<p>You will need to buy these two items from a <a href="http://www.fivebelow.com/">Five Below</a> discount shop:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Slate Prop - $5</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.fivebelow.com/8-5-x-11-neon-dry-erase-boards.html">8.5 x 11 Eraseable Whiteboard</a> - $2</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Apologies for not giving a product link for the slate prop – I had trouble finding it on the Five Below site. I assure you, it does exist…</em></p>

<h2 id="assembly-instructions">Assembly Instructions</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Break the frame of the whiteboard, and remove the cardboard backing and
the broken frame. You should now have a piece of unencumbered whiteboard.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Position the whiteboard over the slate prop’s useless slate writing. You
can’t write on the slate with chalk, so it is pretty useless as-is.
Center it as best you can, then use strips of duct or gaff tape to attach
the whiteboard surface to the clapper.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use the ruler as a straight-edge to draw sharpie lines to denote the
different markable areas on your slate. In the best penmanship you can
muster, label them with the sharpie.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>It is a pretty simple hack, but quite effective for giving your editor a bit
of A/V sync assistance.</p>

    <link href="http://jbuchbinder.com/2014/05/12/boom/"/>
    <updated>2014-05-12T08:44:19-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://jbuchbinder.com/2014/05/12/boom</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There are quite a few guides, tutorials, videos, and other resources on how to
capture usable boom audio. Most of these have a few usable sections with a
bunch of fluff or useless information accompanying them. This is my attempt to
compile a “quick guide” to capturing usable boom audio, assuming you don’t have
a competent audio engineer in your employ (which I highly recommend). Audio is
half of your deliverable product, as a cinematographer, so you should make sure
that you capture the highest quality audio possible.</p>

<h2 id="proximity-reflections-and-the-inverse-square-law">Proximity, Reflections, and the Inverse Square Law</h2>

<p>Much like light, sound decreases exponentially as you move away from the source
of the sound. One of the first things which you will realize when starting to
capture audio is that it sounds increasingly awful as you move further away –
which can be attributed to two things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>As you move further away, relative volume decreases</strong>. The background
sounds (“noise floor”, for anyone trying to be technical), consisting of both
the present background noises and any noises introduced in the recording
process, increase when you increase the sensitivity of your recording
equipment. As the source sound becomes quieter, bringing sound up in post
production will also increase that noise. <em>(If anyone says “just record some
room tone”, ignore them; it won’t help you if your source recording is
terrible, since that’s only a solution if you can gate and isolate the
primary sounds in post.)</em> This is one of the compelling reasons why boom
operators are utilized; they allow a recording to be made from closer to
the source.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Reflections</strong>. Light bounces off of everything, as we are taught, and we
have to be careful to deal with those reflections, in terms of color,
brightness, et cetera. Sound does the same thing. It bounces off of surfaces,
but because sound travels slower than light, we <em>notice</em> when it takes a
few milliseconds longer for sound to arrive at our recording device. Even
more insidious, those reflections (which take on different properties and
sounds based on the materials on which they are reflecting) can sound
<em>louder</em> than the original sound – which will make your recording sound
terrible. The closer you are in proximity to the source, the softer the
reflections will be, in comparison to the original sound.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="polarpickup-patterns">Polar/Pickup Patterns</h2>

<p>Not all microphones, or even microphone <em>types</em> are created equal. They all have
different “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microphone#Microphone_polar_patterns">polar patterns</a>”
which describe the areas of sensitivity which the microphones use to pick up
sound. When attempting to capture dialog, for example, an omnidirectional
microphone would be a poor choice, as it picks up sound equally from all
directions, taking away the ability to create greater isolation for the primary
sound source. The most popular boom microphone type is the “shotgun” microphone,
which has a very directed polar pattern, allowing specific isolation of the
sound in question.</p>

<h2 id="levels-peaking-and-limiting">Levels, Peaking, and Limiting</h2>

<p>Getting the recording level <em>just right</em> is one of the more tricky parts of
recording external boom audio. If the audio is too high, “peaking” will occur.
Peaking is the phenomenon which can be heard when the top part of a sinusoidal
wave (which naturally recorded sounds have) becomes squared when the top of the
wave is clipped by hitting the top limit for recording signal. If the audio is
too low, the signal-to-noise ratio will be too low, and bringing the signal up
to a usable level will bring the sound floor up to an obscenely loud level –
making gating nearly impossible to perform.</p>

<p>To properly deal with this, you need to adjust the signal level so that the
loudest sound comes in under 0 dB, which is where most recorders “peak”. If
certain sounds surpass 0 dB, some audio recorders have the ability to apply a
“limiter” effect, which will push the sound level back down to a usable value
as it is recorded. It’s not a desired effect, but it can save you from
clipping.</p>

<p>As you’re adjusting audio levels, you’ll see a constantly fluctuating level of
audio when no primary sound source is active. This is the “sound floor”, and
should be as far away from the bulk of the primary sound levels as possible.</p>

<h2 id="portable-recording-devices">Portable Recording Devices</h2>

<p>I recommend avoiding the <a href="http://amzn.to/1jyOxm5">Tascam DR-40</a> unit unless
you’re <em>positive</em> that you are using a balanced microphone. It tends to have a
weird firmware issue which produces a
<a href="http://www.dvxuser.com/V6/showthread.php?268124-Tascam-Dr-40-Buzz-Clicking-noise">strange clicking sound</a>
(almost impossible to remove) every quarter of a second when presented with an
unbalanced microphone. If you’re worried about this, go for the
<a href="http://amzn.to/QAUvXD">Zoom H4n</a>. It’s a bit more expensive, but it seems to
handle less expensive microphones in a more able fashion, as well as having
signal limiting and a host of other interesting features.</p>

<h2 id="compression-and-formats">Compression and Formats</h2>

<p>Most digital recorder units will record, at a minimum MP3 and WAV formats. WAV
is an uncompressed audio format, which means that it takes up more storage space
than a compressed format, but retains all of the information captured (at the
resolution captured). MP3 is a compressed format, using a psycho-acoustic model,
which means that it drops pieces of information which it figures we aren’t going
to be able to hear. MP3 files take up a smaller amount of space compared to
the same resolution WAV files – but that comes at the cost of throwing some
of the information out. MP3 @ 192kbps or above tends to have enough information
for most uses.</p>

<h2 id="equipment">Equipment</h2>

<p>There’s no “correct” equipment which you need to purchase to be able to capture
boom audio properly. There are, however, a few piece of equipment you’re
probably going to need.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Extendable Boom Pole</strong>. It’s tempting to go with a converted painters’
pole, but trust me – it pays to go with a decent boom pole. This is mainly
due to the additional noises which can be generated by swinging around a
makeshift boom pole. I personally recommend the
<a href="http://amzn.to/1l3TQaQ">On Stage MBP7000</a> boom pole for budget operators. It
doesn’t have an internal mic cable, but it works very well.</li>
  <li><strong>Microphone Cable (XLR)</strong>. This is an easy place to skimp for some people,
but you don’t want to pick up outside noise, so make sure you go with a
shielded XLR cable which is a few feet longer than the maximum size of your
boom pole, fully extended.</li>
  <li><strong>Clip / Shockmount / Zeppelin / Windscreen</strong>. You need something to isolate
the microphone from the wind, vibration, and other distorting effects of
the environment, which would distract from otherwise relatively clean
audio. Shockmounts can be had for relatively little, as can windscreens.
A zeppelin can cost a bundle, unless you make a DIY one – but they produce
very clean-sounding results.</li>
  <li><strong>Wire clips / wraps</strong>. Either some electrical tape (a cinematographer’s
best friend, after gaffe tape), or some inexpensive bobble hair ties
(available at most dollar stores) will allow you to keep the XLR cable
near the pole – otherwise you may find it dropping into frame at the most
inopportune times.</li>
  <li><strong>Microphone</strong>. There is a great deal of conjecture over the “best” budget
microphone to use. The most important things to consider are the polar
pickup pattern, the signal-to-noise ratio, and the frequency response of
any microphone you’re testing.</li>
  <li><strong>Portable digital recorder</strong>. Covered in the portable recorder section.</li>
  <li><strong>Headphones</strong>. A set of headphones, preferably full cup earphones, are
essential to monitoring the sound for disturbances and/or interruptions.
My favorite pair is the <a href="http://amzn.to/1qwuDgi">Sennheiser HD-280 PRO</a>,
as they’re relatively inexpensive (under 100 USD), and produce a fairly
accurate reproduction of live audio.</li>
  <li><strong>Storage media</strong>. Make sure you don’t buy off-brand media cards. Try to
stick with SanDisk and Lexar media, if you can. The trick is that these
companies generally tend to QA their products a bit more rigorously than
most off-brand manufacturers. This can make the difference between
usable audio and a very upset director.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="technique-and-directionality">Technique and Directionality</h2>

<p>Rather than iterate all of the techniques involved in actually operating a
boom mic rig, and keeping in mind that pictures are worth a thousand words…</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.viddler.com/player/39021abf/0/">Boom Mic 101</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Audio is half of your deliverables – so make sure your boom operator knows how
to deliver the best possible audio to your audio engineer for post production.
Good luck!</p>

    <link href="http://jbuchbinder.com/2014/05/08/bmpc4k-workflow-with-premiere-and-resolve/"/>
    <updated>2014-05-08T07:05:17-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://jbuchbinder.com/2014/05/08/bmpc4k-workflow-with-premiere-and-resolve</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There are a number of “accepted” workflows for going between Adobe Premiere
(as an NLE) and Davinci Resolve (for color correction/grading) for BMPC4K
footage. I am going to detail the workflow I have been using, which should
be useful both for the BMPC4K camera, as well as the BMPCC and BMCC cameras.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Preparation</strong>. Make sure your camera is producing footage at the 23.98
fps frame rate, rather than 24 fps. “True” 24 fps is not quite the same
thing as the “24P” frame rate we are used to.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Load your media onto your workstation</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Create simple proxies</strong>. Using
<a href="https://github.com/shootthemoonfilms/prores-proxies">prores-proxies</a>,
create “cheap” lower quality proxies encoded using the H.264 codec in
Quicktime files. I have been experimenting with using the “.mpg”
extension to <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/VideoRoad/2012/12/premiere-pro-and-quicktime-and-nikon-oh-my.html">force Premiere to use its own internal Quicktime decoder</a>,
rather than the relatively dodgy external one, but the basic process
is the same.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Edit</strong>. Using the proxy files, edit your footage in Premiere. You do
not have to bother with any fancy transitions or effects yet – just
perform a basic edit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Export to Resolve</strong>. Export a “Final Cut Pro XML” file, using the
File &gt; Export menu option.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Create a new Resolve Project</strong>. Open Resolve, and create a new project.
Import the original files (not the proxies) into your media pool.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Import the XML from Premiere</strong>. Import the “Final Cut Pro XML” export,
with “Automatically import source clips into pool” deselected. This last
part is very important, as it forces Resolve to use the clips you already
have in the Media Pool.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Color Grade</strong>. Perform your color grade in Resolve.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Export</strong>. In the “Delivery” tab, select the whole timeline, choose
“Easy Setup”,and select  “Final Cut Pro XML Round-Trip”. Change any options
here to your liking.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Import Roundtrip XML in Premiere</strong>. Import the Round-Trip XML file in
Premiere. This will bring in all of the graded footage.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Perform the remainder of your edits</strong>. Tweak your footage, copy or
create your title cards, etc.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><em>This is a very basic overview of my current BMPC4K + Resolve + Premiere
workflow right now, and it may change.</em></p>

    <link href="http://jbuchbinder.com/2014/05/07/48-hours-with-the-blackmagic-production-camera-4k/"/>
    <updated>2014-05-07T13:45:23-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://jbuchbinder.com/2014/05/07/48-hours-with-the-blackmagic-production-camera-4k</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This year, my team (<a href="http://www.shootthemoonfilms.com">Shoot the Moon Films</a>),
entered the 2014 <a href="http://48hourfilm.com/en/boston/">Boston 48 Hour Film Festival</a>
for the first time. It’s an interesting experience, going from genre and
parameters to fully formed script, to planning and preproduction, to
shooting and execution, to editing, scoring, grading, and full post-production
in a single weekend. I’ve learned a lot about working with the 
<a href="http://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/blackmagicproductioncamera4k">BMPC4K</a>
camera in that time. I am going to iterate over some of the more important
things that I learned over the weekend.</p>

<h2 id="overheating">Overheating</h2>

<p>This simply did not happen. I had heard some horror stories about the camera
body breaking or overheating after long periods of filming, but even in 
direct sunlight for significant periods of time, I did not find this to be
the case. My EOS body used to overheat more than this one…</p>

<h2 id="nd-filters">ND filters</h2>

<p>My Tiffen 77VND was indispensible. If I didn’t have that single piece of
equipment, every exterior shot would have been very, very different. I wanted
a medium DOF and a standard shutter rate for my exterior shots – which meant
that the sunlight had to be stopped down. The variable ND filter delivered
perfectly.</p>

<h2 id="evf">EVF</h2>

<p>The Cineroid was a life-saver. I do not think I would have done as well
without its superior focus-peaking, crop indications, etc. The only feature
sorely missing from the EVF4CSS is waveforms/scopes, which would have been
a bit more useful than eyeballing the full extent of the dynamic range.</p>

<h2 id="v-mount-batteries">V-mount batteries</h2>

<p>If you are not turning your camera off between takes, you are going to need
more than one battery for a day-long shoot. Do <strong>NOT</strong> skimp on a V-mount
battery charger. They take a very long time to trickle charge, so make sure
you have a rapid charger. Also, spares. They may be expensive, but having to
wait on a battery charging could blow a shoot.</p>

<h2 id="audio">Audio</h2>

<p>This is less a “thing” with the BMPC4K body, and more of a general observation.
You cannot skimp on sound. You just <em>can’t</em>. You can always rely entirely on
tight OTS shots and other closeups and use on-camera mics, but it shuts off
an entire avenue of creative wider shots. A boom operator is <em>not</em> just your
buddy holding a mic on a pole – they need to know what they are doing,
otherwise you could be pushing very substandard audio into post-production.
Especially on a tight time limit, this can make the difference between making
a deadline, or having truly horrendous sound.</p>

<p>Also, get a really competent audio engineer. Preferably a really anal-retentive
one with an insane attention to detail. Even if you have perfect video, really
crappy audio can break the illusion of your film. <strong>DO NOT SKIMP</strong>. SERIOUSLY.</p>

<h2 id="that-pa-or-ad----you-need-them-more-than-you-think">That PA or AD – you need them more than you think</h2>

<p>If someone is not taking copious shot notes, you are going to find yourself
up at some ungodly hour, digging through footage for that shot that you
<em>know</em> you got. Save yourself the trouble, and have someone taking care of
all of that.</p>

<h2 id="proxy-files">Proxy files</h2>

<p>I used a new method of creating intermediate proxy files for editing, since
Premiere was not very cooperative in directly loading the Prores files from
the camera. <em>I made my code public in a project called
<a href="https://github.com/shootthemoonfilms/prores-proxies">prores-proxies</a>.</em> This
little trick made sure that, instead of having to render all of my footage
out at the Davinci Resolve speed of 3-6 fps (on my non-Red-Rocket workstation),
I was able to render it to proxies at about full speed (which was about 24fps).
Without this, I wouldn’t have been able to edit the footage without several
footage drops during the day – if at all – during the limited timeframe I
had to do so.</p>

<h2 id="premiere-quicktime-support-on-windows-is-dog-food">Premiere Quicktime support on Windows is dog food</h2>

<p>Something is wrong with it. I have no idea why, but the QT decoder decided
to “give up the ghost” quite a few times during editing. There is supposedly
a renaming hack, which allows the Premiere internal decoder to handle the
files, but I was not privvy to this information during editing. I will update
my documentation and/or author a post on this at some point in the near future,
as it is <strong>VERY</strong> irritating.</p>

<h2 id="too-many-cooks">Too many cooks</h2>

<p>One person edits. Someone can <em>assist</em> them, but you need to have one editor, 
who makes the decisions as to what goes into your final product. If you try
to “edit by committee”, you may end up with a very tired and frustrated primary
editor, and the possibility of some very incomprehensible footage.</p>

<p>If your editor and director are not the same person, the director sits in
with the editor to make decisions, where they need to be made. Ideally the
script notes, etc, provide enough information to the editor to perform his
job.</p>

<p>Also, do not get caught up in reviewing dailies if you are taking part in a
time-sensitive competition. This is a recipe for disaster.</p>

<h2 id="coloring">Coloring</h2>

<p>Even shooting with 10-bit ProRes 422 HQ, the advantage over H.264 DSLR
footage is immediately apparent. There is a lot of latitude for coloring
and correction, which would simply not be possible with the same level of
output quality with H.264.</p>

<p>I ended up performing a manual grading (as in, no LUTs or presets) for the
project we did, and I am very satisfied with the end result.</p>

<h2 id="grain">Grain</h2>

<p>I love the “film grain” that the sensor on this camera produces. I am sure
that I have mentioned it in earlier posts, but it really does give that
organic film look to your output.</p>

<h2 id="do-not-use-services-like-google-drive-for-your-deliverables">Do not use services like Google Drive for your deliverables</h2>

<p>They tend to like to really hurt you in upstream speeds – only when you are
on serious deadline. A better alternative for large media files is to set up
<a href="http://www.bittorrent.com/sync">btsync</a> on both sides, and transfer with far
more efficiency. You will be glad that you did it.</p>

<h2 id="too-many-hats--sink-ships">Too many hats … sink ships?</h2>

<p>There is serious temptation to wear more than one hat. Hell, we all wear more
than one hat on most small sets. The issue comes when you end up wearing
three or four (director, cinematographer, editor, colorist), and realize that
you do not get to sleep until everything is “out the door”. Delegate. Find
people who are good at this stuff, and let them do it. You do not have to be
good at everything, just find people who are.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I had a good time – but I could have been less stressed out, if I had known
some of this in advance.</p>
