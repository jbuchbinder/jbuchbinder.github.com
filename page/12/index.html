  <div class="entry-content"><p>For all those fans of the venerable <a href="http://www.nslu2-linux.org/">NSLU2</a> (or “slug” as we like to call it), I have another package for OpenSlug/BE. This time it’s <a href="http://lpccomp.bc.ca/remserial/">remserial</a>, a Linux equivalent to the BSD “<a href="http://www.bsdua.org/netfwd.html">netfwd</a>” software, allowing serial ports to be redirected over TCP.</p>

<p>Package: <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?sznttmgdi2c">remserial_0.2000-1_armv5b.ipk</a><br />
Source: <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?nlwtzntt2jw">remserial.tar.gz</a></p>

<p>For those enterprising people who would like to use my <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?nmmwztgj5it">armv5b-softfloat-linux</a> cross compilation toolchain, I have made it available on <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/">mediafire</a> as well. It was compiled with Ubuntu 8.04.1 i386, so that’s the safest bet to use for compilation. I had used the NSLU2 “master makefile” to build it, since the vanilla crosstool had provided me little in terms of usable toolchains for the NSLU2.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>(Again, apologies to the people I stole the title from, the nice guys over at <a href="http://www.crooksandliars.com/">crooksandliars.com</a>.)</em></p>

<p>Every time I think I’ve heard the most awful thing done by religious people…</p>

<p>In the same day, I’ve heard two stories coming from the Catholic Church. Yes, I know, the guys who did the whole “inquisition” thing. But they’ve been keeping their noses clean since at least the 1950s, so I’ll start this off by pointing out that I don’t have any beef with the modern day Catholic Church. They don’t come knocking on my door like <a href="http://www.bible.ca/jw.htm">other pointless suit-festooned fuckers</a> or <a href="http://samuraimohel.wordpress.com/2008/03/26/messianic-jewish-hate-campaign-against-real-jews-in-full-swing/">pray for me to go to hell</a>, so we’re on pretty good terms.</p>

<p>But now I get to hear about a twelve time child molester priest, who, despite violating at least twelve children, is <a href="http://www.courant.com/news/local/statewire/hc-07070848.apds.m0962.bc-ct--prieoct07,0,4449400.story">still a damn priest</a>, is finally asked by *police* to come in to face charges. What the hell is wrong with the Church on this one? Isn’t shielding a child molester simply fueling accusations that all priests are kiddie-fuckers? I mean, come on, you’re seriously screwing up in the P.R. department on this one. If the guy were a school teacher and was caught with his jimmy in a fifth grader, I would think that he would never work again, and more than likely would have *awful* things happen to him in prison. This guy has been doing this stuff for *years* and just gets moved around. Must be nice to be in J.C.’s posse.</p>

<p>The second point is the <a href="http://www.courant.com/news/nationworld/wire/sns-ap-eu-vatican-pius-xii,0,7223261.story">whitewashing of Pope Pius XII</a> of any sort of culpability in the holocaust. He didn’t exactly hold open the doors of the gas chamber, but by most accounts he <a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/anti-semitism/pius.html">did absolutely nothing</a>. Now, I’m not sure exactly how far the criteria for becoming a Saint has fallen, but I’m sure letting people die isn’t exactly one of the prerequisites for it. I mean, <a href="http://www.americancatholic.org/Features/teresa/Sainthood.asp">Mother Teresa</a> has had a long road to it, after having spent many years tending to sick people. Pius let a total of <a href="http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h1677.html">between 10 and 26 million people die</a> during the Nazi’s reign — and he gets to be a Saint?</p>

<p>I know Ratzinger was in the <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article382076.ece">Official Hitler Fan Club</a>, but isn’t this a little much? His excuse for not having shot anyone as a Nazi Youth was an “infected finger.” Not that he didn’t want to, not that he objected, that he had a <em>bad finger</em>. At least <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_John_Paul_II">the last guy</a> actually improved things when he was pope, and in fact issued an apology for the exact thing that Ratzinger is trying to promote the sainthood for: <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/religion/jan-june98/vatican_4-8.html">doing jack squat during the holocaust</a>… and maybe a little <a href="http://www.fantompowa.net/Flame/the_vatican.htm">money laundering</a>. Who let this particular joker be pope, anyways?</p>

<p>I think the Vatican kinda needs to get its act together. I’d rather go back to laughing and pointing at stupid sex scandals and child molestation in <a href="http://www.watchtowerinformationservice.org/childabuse.htm">much lower hanging fruit</a> than having to see a 2000 year old institution made a laughing stock by poor leadership. Well, Ratzinger, ball’s in your court. Don’t make the Jewish guy on the cross cry any more than you have to.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently, you may have heard about certain <a href="http://tpmelectioncentral.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/09/obsession_dvd_distributors_wer.php">alarmist crap</a> being circulated in the guise of educational information to people in so called “swing states” in the upcoming 2008 election. Usually this crap doesn’t get an audience, but some of the kooks have been coming out of the woodwork, bitching at the top of their lungs about “islamic fundamentalism” and terrorist, and “oh! think of the children!”</p>

<p>Some people already think that the September 11, 2001 attacks were <a href="http://erlenda5.blogspot.com/">false flag</a> attacks, but regardless, it couldn’t have played better. We have a long and illustrious <a href="http://social.infowars.com/blog_entry.php?user=ericdubay&amp;blogentry_id=4945">history</a> of taking the stupid reaction to anything bad happening. Look as far back as the Revolutionary War or any of the conflicts with Native Americans. Demonize the other guys, we get to be the good guys, who can argue with that?</p>

<p>The United States could have cared less about World War II until the Pearl Harbor attack … and even then America wasn’t involved in WWII because of Nazi atrocities, but more because we wanted to kill Japanese people (and all of their colleagues), to “put right” the attack on Pearl Harbor.</p>

<p>Even before the end of WWII, we were already focused on the “new evil”, being Stalin’s USSR. For years, “communists” were “them” and “capitalists” were us, despite our habit of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_Chilean_coup_d'état">disposing democracies</a> in favor of dictatorships depending on their supposed strategic worth. The most important part of this was that most people hadn’t met a “communist”, but were willing to blame all of their problems on them, to the point of holding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCarthyism">witch trials</a>.</p>

<p>But the next generation of hatred started with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_hostage_crisis">Iranian hostage crisis</a>, when we decided that the guys in the middle east were a good target for us to hate. In the last ten years or so, guys like the <a href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Project_for_the_New_American_Century">PNAC</a> have been pushing for us to assert our American way over the supposed “savages”. Reminds you of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crusade">another time</a>, doesn’t it? Be afraid of the scary dark people, they’ll chop your heads off and blow up your buildings!</p>

<p>Of course, those don’t hold any more water than saying that the KKK is an accurate representation of Christianity, but it doesn’t even slow down the fearmongering. It’s just amazing that we’re all so xenophobic and hatefilled that we have to blame all of the world’s problems on a group of people we don’t understand very well. Economy sucks? Must be the blacks and the Muslims! Thinking of voting for something a little different for president? If you do, the blacks and the Muslims will get you! (We can always blame “the minorities” for everything, but we’re obviously not racist because we have at least one friend from that minority.)</p>

<p>This is the kind of thing that makes me <a href="http://james.lab6.com/2007/01/05/racism-and-nationalism-are-the-same-thing">hate Nationalism</a>, and <a href="http://www.adequacy.org/stories/2001.7.19.83250.1989.html">hate sports teams</a>. It’s all the same concept as racism, after all. Divide people up with artificial distinctions, and give yourself a reason to dislike people.</p>

<p>But it’s amazing how the herd instinct is so powerful in is that it keeps us from looking out for our own good. Look at the number of <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9a03e4d81639f93ba25752c0a9629c8b63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all">people who voted for Bush in 2004 because they were afraid</a> of terrorism. Mind you, people have been doing terrorist-like things here for years, but <a href="http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/notorious/mcveigh/dawning_1.html?print=yes">white Christian guys doing the same thing</a> apparently isn’t the same thing. Or maybe we can’t tell by his face that he isn’t one of “us”.</p>

<p>There are already a number of attempts to <a href="http://rawstory.com/news/2008/For_campaigns_now_its_personal_1006.html">equate one of the Presidential candidates with terrorism</a> (them). It’s crap, of course, since all of the attacks have been <a href="http://216.87.173.33/media/2008/0810/msnbc_ko_comment_palin_terrorists_081006a.flv">debunked ad nauseum</a>, but when has that ever stopped “us” from going after “them”? I would have been more upset with the other guy talking about <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jared-bernstein/the-most-important-piece_b_101237.html">the death of social services</a>, since that affects people, but what do I know? People actually living with the assistance of social programs still vote Republican — I have no idea why, but they do.</p>

<p>The thing I worry about is that <a href="http://library.thinkquest.org/C004367/eh4.shtml">social darwinism</a> is a crock of crap, as is pure capitalism. But we’re operating on the idea that the possible worst case scenarios, “welfare queens” (which is code for “black”, even though no one really wants to use that word) are a fringe, not the majority, but somehow that has eeked its way into the public consciousness. Why should we, as honest hard-working Americans, pay to support other people? Because we’re going to be paying for some sort of programs, and I guess its up to us whether we’re paying for Wall Street execs or people who actually *need* the money. Or war, we can spend it on war…</p>

<p>Please, everyone, don’t vote with a herd mentality. It hurts my head to think that people are that petty and stupid.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Before a friend clued me in to the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/embeddedgmetric/">embedded gmetric</a> project, I had needed to strip out just the gmetric binary for use in monitoring a process on the NSLU2 I was using.</p>

<p>So, for anyone who is interested, I have posted both a <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/file/ixjnx2sjwue/gmetric_3.1.1_1.armv5teb.ipk">binary ipkg package</a> for OpenSLUG/BE and a <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/file/wdnlyyyr6wi/gmetric-src-3.1.1.tar.bz2">source package</a> containing all of the pieces I yanked from the ganglia 3.1.1 distribution to create it. (Graciously hosted by <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/">mediafire.com</a>…) Hopefully this can be of use to someone.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There have been a number of truly awful and stupid things going on in the world, but I think I’m going to pick on a very particular piece of stupid.</p>

<p>In case it was overshadowed by other, larger economic news, we just <a href="http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12341970">bailed out GM, Ford and Chrysler to the tune of 25 *billion* dollars</a>. I’d like to believe that it’s all due to horrible economic conditions — but I’m starting to think it might have a bit more to due with <a href="http://knowledge.emory.edu/article.cfm?articleid=1148">having their heads up their asses</a>. We love putting out big, pointless gas guzzling crapboxes like the <a href="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1374/is_/ai_57800251">Excursion</a>, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Business/story?id=3326593">Humvee</a>, and the <a href="http://mygasguzzler.com/">Navigator</a>.</p>

<p>Then I catch a television commericial from <a href="http://caddyinfo.com/wordpress/?p=436">Cadillac</a> regarding a hybrid version of their fuel sucking Escalade line. Small print indicates that it gets less than 14 MPG… but the real kick in the nuggets comes from GM’s site on it … <a href="http://www.gmfleet.com/pages/submodelOverview/2009_Cadillac_Escalade Hybrid_Hybrid.jsp">is that it costs at least $71,000</a>.</p>

<p>I should start by saying that <em>no one</em> needs one of those. It’s a serious “check out my shiny silver-rimmed penis” thing, and that particular mentality is a great deal of why we have no damn public transportation industry, and indeed why we bend over for at least 10% of our paychecks to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia">fund some pretty awful people</a> halfway around the world.</p>

<p>My question to the auto industy is this: are you fucking kidding me? You know we’re in an awful economic climate where new car sales are down because no one has any credit nor cash on hand to buy these overpriced turkeys outright, and you insist on created expensive luxury vehicles which shore up our gas prices (basic supply and demand going on here, no PhD required) and then tack on the word “hybrid” so the rich fuckers who can buy these things can go back to <a href="http://www.southparkstuff.com/season_10/episode_1002/epi1002script/">sniffing their own farts</a> and pretending that they’re doing something positive in the world?</p>

<p>Hybrids are, by design, a horrible kludge to keep us all using gasoline, even if it’s only to a lesser degree, because Americans don’t want to transition away from their shiny metal wangs. I mean, we kinda <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_American_Streetcar_Scandal">killed our train lines</a>, and have a really sorry excuse for busses and shuttles in all but our most populated areas. Europe has been trying to transition to solar and geothermal power with some distributed charging stations ; still avoiding the issue of people still thinking that everyone needs a car, but at least not requiring petrol.</p>

<p>We’re <a href="http://dsc.discovery.com/convergence/addictedtooil/addictedtooil.html">addicted to oil</a>, and until <a href="http://www.gm.com/">shitheads</a> start thinking about things other than trying to juice people for more money for large, pointless vehicles, we’re kinda stuck with this stuff. Let’s hope <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercapacitor">super capacitor</a> technology picks up, and maybe we we’ll see long range EVs for less than 20k$.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you’ve been outside of a cave in the last few days, chances are that you’ve heard about <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gca54s0LCP-1CIz0sSK5QWjOCzbgD937TGL80">Lehman Brothers</a>, the latest of the investment firms to fail miserably due to the incredible sham that has been the American housing market. Early news today is showing that foreign markets are starting to fail, and it looks as though AIG may be the next major dropping point.</p>

<p>I’m not sure exactly how low this goes, but my guess is that we’re going to pay for those crooked brokers and investment bankers. Everyone is losing, and losing hard.</p>

<p>There are a few great myths of American culture. One is “house equals security”. In case anyone has been paying attentiont to <a href="http://www.homesoverseas.co.uk/news/us-foreclosure-rates-reach-record-high/17031">record foreclosure rates</a>, that’s a crock of crap these days. Another one is “investing is safe and prudent”. That particular turd has been shoved down our throats by the very fuckers who are trying in vain to have us bail them out. Who hasn’t seen commercials filled with happy, young, vibrant Americans, saving for their future by investing with (insert failing investment bank name here)? Of course, we’ve been busy <a href="http://desertbeacon.blogspot.com/2008/03/bush-dresses-deregulation-wolf-in.html">deregulating everything</a>, so it’s not like we shouldn’t have seen this one coming a mile away. That whirring sound you hear is FDR <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Raw-Deal-Republicans-Destroy-Security/dp/0976062127">spinning in his grave</a>.</p>

<p>Don’t even get me started on the whole college thing, either. I think I was about 14 the last time I seriously believed any of that was about *learning*. It’s about hedging your bets — I “bet” I can pay off these massive school loans with the job I’ll get from the degree I’m earning. If you can’t, you get to spend the rest of your days working for some large financial institution. You have to pay for it, sooner or later. To quote someone I read recently: <em>“Slavery is slavery no matter how nicely the master treats you.”</em></p>

<p>“What about heads and pikes”, you may ask… Well, back in the day, there was a very terrible ruler named <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vlad_III_the_Impaler">Vlad the Impaler</a>. When his country was about to be overrun by a Turkish army, Vlad implaled twenty thousand of his own people on pikes. The very sight of this led the Turkish army to avoid Wallachia altogether.</p>

<p>The thing that I’ve been wondering for quite some time is: why isn’t anyone being held accountable? Executives who are suckling enormous quantities of funds into places which they know are bad investments are walking away with hundreds of millions of dollars in “golden parachutes”, some of which are bankrolled by irritated taxpayers like myself. It’s kind of like I walked up to a co-worker, shit on their desk, burned down their house, then walked away with an extra special performance bonus. If any of these people were held accountable for this, perhaps they wouldn’t continue to behave in such an irresponsible way. It would be far too much for me to think that we could ever strip all assets and benefits from executives like that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Schwartz">asshole Schwartz</a>, who did nothing other than bomb a company out, to walk away with an enormous sum of money?</p>

<p>Or perhaps an angry mob of investors who have lost their retirements and life savings based on happy-looking television advertisements could tear one of these people to shreds in a parking lot. Not that I’d ever advocate it…. I’m just as surprised as everyone else that it hasn’t happened yet.</p>

<p>UPDATE: If anyone would like to focus some unmitigated anger at someone, try Phil Gramm, the guy who brought you the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramm-Leach-Bliley_Act">Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_Futures_Modernization_Act_of_2000">Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000</a>. Did I forget to mention he’s <a href="http://www.imvotingrepublican.com/">John McDud’s</a> current economic advisor?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have just posted the first set (from the first two hours) of John Mayer’s summer music festival (here affectionately titled “JohnFest”) from 2008 here:</p>

<p>The technical details … I used my trusty Thinkpad T61 with the Behringer UCA202 to pull sound off the board. As usualy, this means that the quality of the recording is based solely on the job of the mixing engineer. It was cut using mp3cut and normalized using mp3norm, as with most of the Stonewall Tavern recordings. Keep watching for the remaining hours to be posted.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This past week, I stumbled on a strange problem with Dell “PERC” RAID controllers in certain rackmount servers, where they would suddenly just stop working for no apparent reason. The nice people at Dell did actually have firmware available for the PERC 3 and 4 controllers to fix this problem, which was pretty nice.</p>

<p>The part that *wasn’t* nice was that they were some stupid <a href="http://www.eskimo.com/~webguy/writings/winsucks.html">Windows</a> binaries which required a floppy disk to be inserted.</p>

<p>First of all, who has a laptop with a floppy drive anymore, and second of all, what if you, like other sane people, don’t use Windows? Thirdly, how often does a floppy disk magically fail to work in a floppy drive?</p>

<p>I ended up doing the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create a <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> VM</li>
  <li>Use <code>dd if=/dev/zero of=floppy.img bs=1k count=1440</code> to create a floppy image, which I mounted in the VirtualBox</li>
  <li>“Format” the floppy image in the VM, because apparently Dell’s fuqtard utility can’t write an image to an unformatted disk.</li>
  <li>Use the stupid utility to write the floppy image.</li>
  <li>Use <code>mkisofs -pad -b floppy.img -R -o cd.iso floppy.img</code> to create a CD image</li>
</ul>

<p>Dell, I hate you. Your laptops overheat and suck out loud, and your stupid Windows-only disks and defective RAID controllers bother me. I’m not buying any more of your hardware. You can subsidize Microsoft some other way.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote>
  <p><em>“The definition of stupidity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.” — Albert Einstein</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>America has at least a 30 year history of, more often than not, electing the dud. And by dud, I mean the absolutely least qualified or least desirable person for the job. Take a quick look at Saint Ron. That guy was an <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0043325/">awful actor</a>, <a href="http://www.observer.com/2008/if-mccains-apostate-so-was-reagan">sub-par governor</a>, and an absolute <a href="http://www.neilrogers.com/news/articles/2004061209.html">crapbox</a> <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/economy/jan-june04/reagan_6-10-04.html">President</a>. And yet he appeared “strong on terrorism” versus Carter, who actually turned out to be <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views05/0503-22.htm">right about our petrol based economy</a>. Too bad that Reagan <a href="http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/nsa/publications/irancontra/irancon.html">loved him some terrorists</a>. Oh, I’m sorry, we called them “freedom fighters.” Blowing shit up is still blowing shit up.</p>

<p>Then let’s look at his protege, Bush Senior. Ran against a pretty unassuming guy in Michael Dukakis, but didn’t have anything other than the bubble of Reagan, or perhaps <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC9j6Wfdq3o">horribly racist campaigning</a>. He got booted after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read_my_lips:_no_new_taxes">notably lying</a> about raising taxes. Or maybe it was that <a href="http://www.spike.com/video/hidden-wars-of/2677786">Oil War</a> we dove into so easily …</p>

<p>And then there’s the current dud. There are vast tracts of the <a href="http://www.snopes.com/politics/bush/google.asp">internet</a> <a href="http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/20080318_bushs_legacy_of_failure/">devoted</a> <a href="http://www.ourfuture.org/blog-entry/bushs-global-failure-tour">entirely</a> to the <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2006/09/08/george-bush-awful-president-or-the-awful-est-president/">cyclone</a> of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/28/us/nationalspecial/28bush.html">suck</a> that is <a href="http://supremeirony.blogspot.com/2006/01/george-bush-complete-failure.html">George W Bush</a>. The guy hasn’t ever succeeded in <a href="http://alaric3rh.home.sprynet.com/science/bceo.html">anything</a> in his life … and we somehow elected him. <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2109275/">Twice</a>. Why? (mumble mumble) Terrorism (mumble mumble) Al Qaeda (mumble mumble) Saddam Hussein (mumble mumble) Weapons (mumble mumble) … We’re a bunch of incredible tools for continuing to do this.</p>

<p>But the greatest surprise to me is that a guy who is <a href="http://www.salon.com/opinion/feature/2008/03/12/mccain/">like Bush</a> <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/05/27/mccain-voted-with-bush-10_n_103718.html">more than 95% of the time</a> can possibly have a higher approval rating. It’s like we’re spreading our collective ass cheeks and telling the rich guys who have been fucking us terribly for the last eight years to have another four to impact our National Colon. Bush is polling at somewhere between 22 and 31 percent, according to <a href="http://www.pollingreport.com/BushJob.htm">pollingreport.com</a>, yet McCain seems to have <a href="http://www.pollingreport.com/wh08.htm">higher ratings across the board</a>, even though his policies don’t differ very much from Bush’s policies. NPR had an <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=18299693">interesting take</a> on some of this as well.</p>

<p>Amazingly, we’re faced with a pretty no-brain decision…. We’ve had eight years of disasterous leadership in every area, and have a choice between a candidate who wants to continue doing it and one who doesn’t. I’m *amazed* that we’re not all dead from trying to eat food through our ears or something. There’s just something wrong with most of the people in this country that this isn’t a “slam dunk”. And Democrats, don’t think you’re not off the hook. If you can’t get people to vote for you in *this* election, what the hell are you doing wrong?</p>

<p>I always remember that Bush has at least a 20% approval rating, which means that out of five random people, one of them has parents who are brother and sister, or who has to be told how to breathe. This ain’t that difficult to figure out, guys, you picked a dud *twice*. Strong leadership means admitting to mistakes, not trying to jam a square peg into a round hole until you break the peg. But McCain has been polling above 40%, which is again testing my faith in humanity. The guy isn’t charismatic, doesn’t have good stances on any of the important issues facing the next President, and looks like he’s being eaten by a liver spot. I would have said “unelectable” if I had been asked a year ago. But apparently, reality is suspended, again, for an election cycle, and the Dud will triumph, again.</p>

<p>I would come up with something witty to say here, but I’m just really saddened that it has come down to this. My whole life, I’ve wanted a President who would, you know, care about the environment, energy conservation, and a thousand other things that Presidents *should* care about, but don’t. If we can’t move away from petrol when it costs us more than ever to purchase it, what the hell is wrong with us? I just hope that everyone is happy with The Dud, since we’re going to get four years of that.</p>

<p>Oh, and Joe Lieberman sucks ass. I voted against him in the last election, and will do so again if given the chance. Sorry, just had to get that one in there.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The last time I was ranting, it was about <a href="/2008/08/18/the-god-bullshit/">the joke that is the current seperation between church and state</a>. But I think it’s time to take a look at the other part of this mess — us.</p>

<p>“People of faith” seems to be a term which is bandied about an awful lot, which is meant to convey to other people that Jeebus or the Flying Spaghetti Monster, or your multi-armed deity of choice, is watching over them, and is ready to smite at a moment’s notice. Seems to be more Jeebus’s guys, since they’re <a href="http://www.adherents.com/rel_USA.html#religions">the most prevalent in America right now</a>, strangely followed by secular people (but not very closely).</p>

<p>I was under the impression for a very long time that religion was supposed to be some sort of special moral code, to keep people living a good life and being nice to other people. A rabbi in an old story said all of their religious teachings could be summed up in <a href="http://www.jcu.edu/philosophy/gensler/goldrule.htm">the golden rule</a>. You know, treat other people the way you’d like to be treated. Doesn’t exactly take nailing some guy to a piece of wood to figure that out.</p>

<p>The disparity I see seems to be that, while the majority of Americans identify themselves as being some variety of Jeebus’s flock, <a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/chr_prac2.htm">at least half of the voting ones seem to vote Republican</a>. And as we all know by the teachings of <a href="http://www.buzzflash.com/contributors/03/09/17_franken.html">Supply Side Jesus</a>, the guy these people follow would be tarred and feathered by the modern day Republican party. So what gives here?</p>

<p>The most rational explanation that I’ve been given has to do with abortion. (Oh noes! Killing teh babies!) Republicans have more or less taken the <a href="http://www.ontheissues.org/Celeb/Republican_Party_Abortion.htm">let God sort ‘em out</a> sort of way. Who gives a shit if you’re raped? Just pop ‘em out, they’ll add to the flock… I’m sure all of this works just as well as <a href="http://www.rhrealitycheck.org/blog/2007/04/13/burying-release-of-abstinence-only-report-on-friday-the-13th-seems-fitting">abstinence only education</a> and that albatross of “intelligent design”. Apparently church-goers originally leaned towards the Democratic party, with their platform of social responsibility and, you know, caring for their fellow man. But <a href="http://www.newsbatch.com/abort.htm">around the time of the Vietnam War</a>, the Republican party said “if you’re not with us, you’re for killing babies.” And pastors and ministers flocked like the sheep they are to a party which offered them <a href="http://media.mcclatchydc.com/smedia/2008/08/20/12/145-08202008judge08212008.slideshow_main.prod_affiliate.91.jpg">no more than disapproving of abortion</a>.</p>

<p>And here’s where it gets interesting…. Because of this, <a href="http://www.republicansforobama.org/?q=node/1668">Republicans don’t want abortion to go away</a>. It’s one of the few things with which they can keep their “flock” of loyal Jeebus-ites at bay.</p>

<p>Ugh.</p>

<p>And then there’s Gay marriage. For some reason, these bible thumpers think it’s an an anathema to let other people do what they want to do. No babies are harmed, or anything…. what gives on that one? There’s some very strong social stigma (at least among males in America) to <a href="http://www.avert.org/hsexu3.htm">strongly dislike gay men</a> (but openly <a href="http://www.safalra.com/other/why-men-like-lesbians/">want to watch gay women going at it</a>, go figure), probably under the auspices that unless you *hate* gay people, they might turn you gay. I would use the example that someone can no more choose to be gay than they could choose to be black, but apparently we <a href="http://www.simplcom.ca/lnq/mlk3/blackslavery.html">used to hate black people and think them inferior too</a>. Hold on, was that <a href="http://www.christianaggression.org/item_display.php?id=1123883541&amp;type=articles">backed by Jeebus’s folks as well</a>?</p>

<p>Look guys, your bearded savior was one of my people. You know, <a href="http://www.ushmm.org/research/center/church/persecution/persecution.pdf">a jew</a>. Somehow, this keeps getting lost when the debates come up. Not only was he Jewish, but he also was <a href="http://www.lcurve.org/writings/BiblicalLiberal.htm">a socialist</a>. Funny that. So, when you’re about to go into the voting booth, think about that poor Jewish guy tacked on a cross around your neck, and remember that he’s crying about you fucking the ideals that he got nailed there for in the first place. Then don’t vote for the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/08/hess-contributions-preceded-mccain.html">schmuck</a> (you know, a dud is a dud, no matter how many POW camps he’s been in). It’s pretty simple, America, and even though you’ve shown me how <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/world/newsid_3977000/3977441.stm">stupid</a> you can be, I’d hope that you can get it right this time. Don’t get distracted by <a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2008/jun/19/MCCAINOIL/">shiny objects</a> or <a href="http://www.crooksandliars.com/2008/07/28/chuck-hagel-on-mccain-attack-ad-hes-treading-on-some-very-thin-ground-here/">colorful pictures</a>, think about the crying Jewish guy around your neck.</p>
