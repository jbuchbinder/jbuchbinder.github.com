The lens of your camera is arguably one of the most important parts of the
camera ; it has the job of controlling light, adjusting focus (and focal
length in variable focal length lenses), controlling depth-of-field
through the aperture, and adding character to the shots you have lovingly
framed. *(It should be noted that the sensor of a digital video camera
body is also very important, in terms of sensitivity, resolution, size,
and other factors, but it is out of the scope of this article.)*

There are quite a few factors to consider when choosing the lens you will
use for a shot, as well as the lenses you will pack for a shoot. Do you
pack one or two variable focal-length lenses, or do you pack a series of
strategic length prime lenses? Do you stay with your native lens mount?
Do you use vintage lenses? Do you need super-fast lenses?

As of the writing of this, I've been known to primarily use three or four
prime lenses (24mm, 35mm, 50mm, and 85mm), while packing a 105mm or 135mm
with a set of extension tubes for extreme macro usage. This setup will
**not** work for everyone, as I will explain.

## Lens Mount

There are several types of lens mounts, and depending on the type of camera
body you use, one (or two) will be a "native" mount. For example, if you
shoot using a Canon EOS camera (T3i, 7D, 5D mk3, C100, etc), you will most
likely be using primarily EF mount lenses (and/or EF-S lenses if you aren't
shooting with a full-frame sensor). These native lenses have the advantage
of having auto-focus / focus-confirmation electronics, as well as being able
to mount with no additional hardware required. Auto-focus isn't really an
issue with cinematography, and focus-confirmation isn't a *huge* advantage,
especially if your camera has focus peaking -- but these lenses were
*designed* to work with your camera body.

Other lens mounts can be accommodated with adapter rings, which can usually
be purchased for varying amounts from online retailers. I have a few
M42 adapter rings for using old Pentax screw-mount lenses with the EF mount
on my camera, and they work flawlessly for me. Some of the more expensive
ones even have focus confirmation capabilities.

Photographers might give some pause to the idea of not having focus
confirmation or auto focus, but cinematographers should be fine with it.
Lens mount should only factor into your decision to use a lens by whether
or not you have the appropriate adapter ring configuration to use that
lens, in my opinion.

## Prime or Variable Focal Length (Zoom)

A great deal of the answer to this question depends on the primary type
of cinematography in which you tend to engage. A variable focal length
lens is essentially a single lens which offers an "infinite number of
focal lengths between its two bounds", but there are other factors to be
considered when using one. For example, many lower-cost variable focal
length lenses will tend to have variable maximum apertures, depending on
the target focal length.

If you're engaged in documentary cinematography or non-planned shoots
(such as many modern "web series" shoots), you may want to stick with
the widest range of variable focal length lens you can accommodate. A
24-70mm lens will usually handle most shots which would be required by
those mediums, and will mostly eliminate the hassle of changing lenses
during critical (and possibly situationally-limited) shoot times.

A serious trade-off is that most variable focal length lenses are not
"fast" (i.e. do not have a very low f-stop number for their maximum
aperture size), and therefore tend to require more light. The faster
lenses among that class tend to increase in cost greatly.

Prime lenses usually do one thing, and try to do it very well. They
range down (and below) f/1.2, and are far more cost effective for a
single focal length. If you have the time to change lenses in between
shots, and tend away from smash zooms (which I tend to find are a bit
over-used) and dolly/zoom combination shots, you might want to tend
towards a collection of primes.

## How fast is fast?

The majority of consumer-grade lenses tend to have smaller maximum aperture
sizes than f/2.8, but there are a fair number of inexpensive primes which
can be had with an f/2.8 maximum aperture size, and relatively inexpensive
(compared to some) lenses can be had down to f/1.4 or so, depending on the
relative concessions you're willing to make regarding the lens quality,
mount, manufacturer, et cetera.

As the aperture size increases, the depth of field decreases in size, but
the amount of light hitting the sensor increases. Low light cinematography
has historically relied on "fast" lenses rather than increased sensor
sensitivity, primarily due to the increasing role that sensor "noise" 
plays at high ISO levels. This tradeoff means that you may have to decide
whether depth of field or light sensitivity will be the primary determining
factor in the maximum aperture rating of the lenses you're using.

*NOTE: Another thing to note is that lenses tend not to be their sharpest
or best when fully open, so you may have to shoot slightly further shut
than the maximum aperture rating.*

## Vintage Lenses

Some cinematographers (and photographers) will *swear* by vintage glass.
Optics from lenses like old Carl Zeiss lenses are still amazing, and some
of these lenses are sold for less than the comparable modern lenses for
them. It can be a potentially *expensive* habit, however, since
cinematographers have been driving up the cost of purchasing these lenses,
as their lack of focus controls is far less bothersome than it would be
to photographers.

If you can purchase vintage lenses (or happen upon a cache of them), it's
something to seriously consider. They have their own character, and when
used thoughtfully, can add much to your footage.

## Focal length

*NOTE: If you're going with variable focal length lenses exclusively, 
you may be able to safely skip this section. It deals mostly with the
reasoning behind using certain focal length lenses.*

Selection of focal length depends on a number of factors. Entire chapters,
and even whole *books* have been written about selecting focal lengths
for cinematography and photography. A great deal of it has to do with
the type of shot you are working with, as well as the framing, etc. I'm
going to hit some of the considerations, but I suggest further reading.

When considering focal lengths on cameras, I tend to consider them using
the standard of a "full frame" sensor, since my camera has one. This means
that the written focal length of a lens corresponds directly to the
*effective* focal length of that lens. A larger "crop factor" (which is
the case for smaller sensor sizes, like the Canon APS-C sensor and the
Micro 4/3 sensors) means that a lens's effective focal length is longer
for those sensors. You can figure out the effective focal length by
multiplying the stated focal length by the crop factor. For example,
an APS-C crop factor is 1.5x, so a 35mm lens would have an effective
focal length of 52.5mm, and a 50mm lens would have an effective focal
length of 75mm.

"Wide angle" shots, which are usually used for establishing shots in
cinema, generally tend to rely on very "wide" lenses, which are lenses
with short focal lengths. As you move further away from 35mm effective
focal length, the field of view present in your frame increases, which
increases geometric distortion towards the edges of the frame. This has
been referred to as a "fish eye" effect, when present in more than
moderate amounts.

As an aside, I have seen cinematographers use extremely wide lenses
(18mm and shorter) to shoot closeup shots of actors and actresses in
tight quarters -- and I must warn against it, unless you are 
**acutely aware** of the geometric distortion which you are introducing
into the frame. This has very unpleasant effects on the faces of actors
when used for close shots, and I know few actors who take kindly to being
represented in a grossly distorted manner.

A 50mm effective focal length is essentially what your eye sees; at least,
that's the way I've come to think of it. It's a very neutral lens to use
for most shots. I recommend that this length be a standard part of any
lens kit you're putting together.

50mm lenses have been popular with the Canon DSLR cinematography crowd,
primarily due to the inexpensive nature of the "nifty fifty", a 50mm
f/1.8 prime which clocks in at a little over 100 USD new. Its optics aren't
that fantastic, but its point of entry is so low in the cost department
that many people will own one. If you do, consider buying an f/1.4 version
of the same lens (or the f/1.2 L, if you're successful, or have some sort
of trust fund laying around), as the optical and build quality is far
superior to the 50mm f/1.8 lens. It's a "midway" focal length, but very
usable for a variety of shots.

Greater than 50mm effective focal lengh lenses are considered "long"
lenses. They tend to "compress" the space they capture, much as wide angle
lenses tend to expand and distort it. One must be careful with using long
lenses for handheld and steadicam work, as camera shake tends to be
magnified with longer lenses. 

Long lenses can also be used for closeup and extreme closeup shots by using
"extension tubes" -- what my brother used to refer to as "expensive air".
They increase the amount of light required, and are not as easy or compact
as most macro lenses, but they're relatively cheap, and cut down on the
number of lenses you have to carry.

## What the hell is a "bokeh"?

The term "bokeh" is a recent addition to the vocabulary of the photographer
and cinematographer ; it simply refers to the blur produced by out of
focus objects, particularly lights, by a lens. It is determined largely by
the quality of the optics of the lens, as well as the number of blades in
the lens's aperture. Higher blade counts generally produce more "pleasing"
bokeh, approaching the cinematic standard of almost circular light blur.

## You haven't told me which lenses!

This isn't intended to dictate which lenses a cinematographer *must* carry,
nor push certain choices over others, but merely to attempt to educate
about sensible lens selection.

Consider buying a Pelican case, or other shock resistant case, for travelling
to shoots. If you're carrying a lot of glass, you can't afford to deal
with the downtime of a broken lens.

There are a huge number of lenses, both modern and "ancient", and you can
equip yourself with any variety of lenses, depending on your particular
idiom and shooting style. Don't fall into the trap of assuming that lens
selection is unnecessary, or that everything should be shot with a single
lens ; it's just another aspect of cinematic creativity. Good luck!
