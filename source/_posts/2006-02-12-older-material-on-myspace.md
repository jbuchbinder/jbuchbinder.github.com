Man, I really don’t like myspace.com very much. Awful design, etc. But, it’s not my bandwidth, so two of my past bands are now up there for anyones’ listening pleasure: [evoke][1] and [Maranatha][2]. I’m hoping to get something new to post soon, but that means I have to spend less time working and more time playing … If anyone is wondering why I \*don’t\* have a personal page there, keep in mind that I [\*hate\*][3] [myspace][4]. And I don’t like Tom and his bad ColdFusion design. Really. Learn PHP or something, man.
