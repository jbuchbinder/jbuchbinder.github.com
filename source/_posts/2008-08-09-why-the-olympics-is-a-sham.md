Maybe you’ve divined from the title that I’m not exactly a supporter of the Olympics.

Of course, I have quite a few reasons why I don’t like them, and why I’m boycotting watching or having anything to do with the [Olympic Games 2008 in Beijing][1].

**1) Human Rights.** Honestly, I don’t think I even have a leg to stand on with regard to this particular issue. It’s not like we [torture people][2], [stifle or censor the press][3], [supress opinion or fundamental rights][4], or [occupy a sovereign nation][5] or anything. Do you feel a [surge][6] of guilt yet? Still, we shouldn’t exactly be \*endorsing\* this sort of thing by going. But how can we prove that [America is the best hung nation on the planet][7] unless we show ‘em the size of our [chemically enhanced collective wang][8]? Which brings me to point two…

**2) Nationalism is Racism.** The very idea that one person is superior to another one just because of where they were born, live, or what they look like. Not like we ever [did something awful][9] [like that before][10]. Still, we’re talking about a set of games which were supposed to promote “goodwill” among nations, and yet has turned into more of a [violent][11] [pissing contest][12] than anything else. The ancient greeks would have been disappointed, I guess, in between bouts of [pederasty][13].

**3. Jim Thorpe.** Assuming he’s not spinning in his grave, one of the greatest athletes of the 20th century would probably have reminded you that [he had his olympic gold medals stripped from him][14] for accepting a few bucks to play a baseball game. What difference could that possibly make, you ask yourself? Well, the Olympics was originally conceived as a way for \*amateur\* athletes from all over the world to compete, not professionals, hence the removal of Mr Thorpe’s medals. But wait a minute …. isn’t there a [USA Dream Team][15] (starring none other than Mr [Date Rape][16] himself) playing in the Olympics? That’s right, they [changed the rules][17] so we can swing our [Nationalist banana hammock][18] around. Fuck fair play, man, *game over*. If you have to put [paid ringers][19] in there, where is your nationalist superiority?
