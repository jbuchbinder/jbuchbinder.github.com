I’m still hard at work on [FreeMED][1] 0.9.0 ; it is turning out to be a very long and involved process. A ton of new functionality is making its way in, along with architectural improvements and porting old functionality. The majority of the codebase has been torn out and rewritten, mostly to allow for complete separation between UI and the data model.

This entire process has been very educational, and I think I have learned more than I ever \*wanted\* to learn about UI programming. Hopefully this will be worth the wait for everyone … it’s looking like the majority of the framework is in place, and porting old modules to the new framework is what is left to be done.
