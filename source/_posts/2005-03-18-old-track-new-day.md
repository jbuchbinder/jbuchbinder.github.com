Over the last week or two, Jake and I have been working on a few older tracks from [some long-gone group][1], including a few which were never finished or released. So far, three tracks have come out of this collaboration. Hopefully Jake can get his hands on the raw tracks from the original recordings so we can do a little creative editing and remixing which will provide a truer sound compared to the one captured on the last released CD of that group.
