  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have recently had cause to proxy a J2EE CXF service through an apache 2.2 instance, and thought it would be nice to share my findings. (This was all done on a Debian system.)</p>

<p>First of all, the mod_proxy pieces have to be enabled using <strong>a2enmod proxy</strong>.</p>

<p>A fragment has to be added with the proxying bits and some limitation:</p>

<pre><code>     Order allow,deny
     Allow from all


ProxyPass /EXPOSEDURL http://SERVER:PORT/URL
ProxyPassReverse /EXPOSEDURL http://SERVER:PORT/URL
</code></pre>

<p>Reloading apache configuration should enable the proxy properly. The only other possible issue is that in addition to the WSDL URL, you’re going to have to specify a “proxy” URL, which is just the service URL without ?wsdl at the end of it. A fragment of PHP’s SoapClient would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>$url = "http://server.domain:8180/services/MySoapService?wsdl";
$sc = new SoapClient( file_get_contents($url), array(
          'login' =&gt; $my_username // optional for basic auth
        , 'password' =&gt; $my_password // optional for basic auth
        , 'compression' =&gt; SOAP_COMPRESSION_ACCEPT | SOAP_COMPRESSION_GZIP
        , 'location' =&gt; str_replace('?wsdl', '', $url) // force this to work through proxies
));
</code></pre>

<p>The magic in that last segment was the “location” parameter, as it specifies the proxy. Good luck!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I really like Ubuntu — I use it for all of my workstations/laptops, and have for the last several years. I do not, however, like it when people tell me that something that’s clearly and demonstrably a bug in a system <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/soyuz/ bug/494081">simply isn’t a bug</a>. Fie on your crappy PPA build system, I’m just not going to build more Ubuntu packages for things. I’ll just go back to only packaging Debian server packages.</p>

<p>Way to build community, Canonical.</p>

<p>I quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>The buildds[sic] have no internet access, so you can’t use installer packages (packages which need to download the undistributable archive from the official location) on buildds (e.g. as build dependencies).</em></p>

<p>I swear, it’s a feature, not a bug.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Kill that damn “healthcare” bill. Kill it dead.</p>

<p>I’m as shocked as anyone else that I’m agreeing with morons who wear teabags on their hats and think that universal healthcare is some bizarre form of fascism, and that everyone is a Nazi. Not to fear, I’m not agreeing with them on *everything*, just on one thing: this “healthcare” bill sucks.</p>

<p>We saw a <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20091221-708724.html">100 </a> <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20091221-708472.html">bump</a> in the DJIA this morning after the Senate passed their bastardization of a health insurance industry subsidy bill. Of course, it had to do with the excise tax being delayed, supposedly. Not anything having to do with 25 million new customers being forced into an industry with little or no regulation. Nope, not that.</p>

<p>Progressives are counting on the bill to be improved on its way back from the House, claiming that it will be better than the version that the Senate watered down. Y’know, because it makes so much sense that these cretins who tear every good measure out of a bill with the mere threat of a tantrum (without having to do the “Mr Smith Goes to Washington” thing) are just going to smile and say “I know we didn’t do this before, but of *course* we’ll do it, now that the House of Representatives said it was okay!” I can’t figure out who are the bigger morons, the Senate democratic leadership or the guys in the Progressive movement eating this up like Frosted Shit Flakes.</p>

<p>All our lame duck president had to do was push single payer, really. It might have been the end of his political career, but would have, much as the civil rights movement revolutionized America, drastically changed the way we live our lives in this country. No more would medical bankruptcy be something with which many families are familiar, and no longer would people fear financial ruin from attempting to seek medical care. I can’t condone mandated private insurance with no real caps on what they can charge or what horrible things they can do to you when you don’t play by their rules.</p>

<p>What happened to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpAyan1fXCE">this guy</a>? Who traded him out for <a href="http://www.pnhp.org/news/2009/march/obama_to_single_paye.php">this dud</a>? With what? Oh yeah. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/08/13/internal-memo-confirms-bi_n_258285.html">Money. Power.</a></p>

<p>Give up the idea that you as a person can do anything. We’re peons, slaves to a country bought and paid for by large industries.</p>

<p>If you don’t believe single payer is not only superior in every imaginable way to the nightmare we have now and would also save us *billions* of dollars, please visit <a href="http://pnhp.org/facts/single-payer-resources">Physicians for a National Healthcare Plan</a>. The huge list of studies, including CBO ones, are eye-opening.</p>

<p>Is it the best possible thing? No. I’m sure there are better systems, somewhere. It’s not socialized healthcare, just socializing the payment structure for it. And that’s not a dirty word, morons. We socialize a lot of things for the common good. Haven’t heard too many fiscal conservatives griping about that <a href="http://www.salem-news.com/articles/december192009/defense_bill.php">636 *billion* dollar spending bill</a>. Oh yeah. ‘Cause it helps us kill the Al-Qaedas that aren’t in Afghanistan and continue blowing holes in the sand to fill them with bundles of freshly printed dollars. Like that ever helped anything. Would you like a <a href="http://www.criticalthinking.org.uk/tigerrepellantrock/">terrorist-repellent rock</a>?</p>

<p>But we’re going to mouse and complain that the government wants to take away our liberty and little American flags. I’d be more concerned with ceding government power to corporations. Privatization doesn’t make things better, it just tacks on a profit “tax” to a social venture. Look at <a href="http://www.wired.com/beyond_the_beyond/2009/12/california-in-ruins-i-blame-the-dominant-ideology-of-the-whole-earth-catalog/">California</a>… that shit is falling apart.</p>

<p>Not to worry. Your healthcare system will be following suit. Please try not to die on the sidewalk.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yep, that’s it. It has been dead for quite some time now. Unfortunately, it’s not always apparent *why* that has been the case.</p>

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> Political and healthcare-related opinions below, linked to various reputable sources.</p>

<p><strong>Public Option, Single Payer, Medicare for All?</strong> The most contentious part of healthcare reform has been the concept of a government run health care plan. <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h111-676">HR 676</a> refers to the idea of “Medicare for All”, extending our Medicare program for seniors to cover all Americans, effectively creating a single payer system in America. As expected, people who <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/byron-williams/republicans-undercut-thei_b_292760.html">didn’t give a crap about running up deficits to blow holes in the sand halfway across the globe</a> were outraged, *outraged* at the idea that we could possibly spend money on healthcare. So much, in fact, that they <a href="http://www.clipsandcomment.com/2009/02/27/idiots-on-camera-clevelands-tea-party-covered-by-blogger-interrupted/">paraded around like morons</a>, complaining about how large and awful government has gotten. (You know, after they didn’t say jack since the *last* Democrat was president.) A simple google search seems to show that the only places that are worried about Medicare deficits are <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=medicare financial crisis">right-wing thinktanks like the “Heritage Society” and Pravda-like news organizations like “Fox News”</a>. Did I forget to mention that Kaiser and BCBS were up there as well? Trusting insurance companies to control costs in healthcare is like handing over a chicken farm to a drooling fox. No mention whatsoever that <a href="http://www.pnhp.org/facts/what_is_single_payer.php">estimates of savings with single payer are in the hundreds of *billions* of dollars</a>. And those estimates aren’t some cherry-picked thinktank garbage. It’s from the CBO. PNHP has a <a href="http://www.pnhp.org/facts/single_payer_system_cost.php?page=all">substantial list</a> of studies which all seem to conclude that we’re flushing money into private insurance companies. Not to mention that <a href="http://www.annals.org/cgi/reprint/148/7/566">59% of doctors favor it</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Don’t let that fool you. The Insurance companies *love* this new bill.</strong> For all their hemming and hawing, the health insurance complex is almost giddy with this new bill, which would allow them to effectively [dump the lowest income, highest risk people][8] onto a publically subsidized [but privately run][9] healthcare system. All the profits, none of the risk. Sounds like Goldman Sachs 101 to me. In a related vein, one of the major reasons that the banking and financial industry has come out against HR 676 was that part of it</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It’s getting closer and closer to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas">big holiday</a> of the winter season. Hell, let’s just call it the “Christmas Season” and get it over with; it’s the 900 pound gorilla in the figurative room.</p>

<p>Christmas, or to be more specific, Christmas *shopping* is the most important time of the year. Economically, that is. Small shops and large chain outlets alike rely on the boom of Christmas present sales to create the bulk of their sales figures for the year.</p>

<p>But what’s this? There’s a recession going on? People are <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2009/03/06/news/economy/jobs_february/index.htm?postversion=2009030608">getting laid off</a>, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/04/opinion/04krugman.html">salaries and benefits are being cut</a>, <a href="http://www.emaxhealth.com/1275/72/33004/health-insurance-premiums-rising-faster-paychecks.html">premiums are rising</a> (and affecting <a href="http://www.nber.org/aginghealth/spring05/w11160.html">paychecks</a> as well), <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/30/AR2009093001696.html">foreclosures are through the roof</a>, <a href="http://www.fdic.gov/bank/individual/failed/banklist.html">over 120 banks have failed this year</a> while the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125907631604662501.html">FDIC is perilously close to being completely out of funds</a>, <a href="http://wallstreetexaminer.com/2008/12/02/looming-inflation-a-matter-of-fact-or-faith/">inflation is getting out of hand</a>, <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm">cost of consumer goods are going up</a> while <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2009/07/watch_for_falling_wages_govern.html">wages are going down</a>.</p>

<p>Not to fear! The powers that be have devised a way to give all of us peons a little more cash, and in effect, artificially buoy sales figures by <a href="http://hubpages.com/hub/unemployment-extension-compensation-act-of-2009-hr-3548-november-3">extending unemployment benefits until just after the “holiday season”</a>. That way, you’re still screwed with no job in an economy that isn’t hiring, but at least you can buy some stuff you don’t need so that those Wall Street stocks don’t go down. Can’t upset that parasite investor class, now, can we? (Incidentally, Naomi Klein had a fantastic piece on the <a href="http://www.thenation.com/doc/20080218/klein">death of the ownership society</a> and how the entire concept of haves and have nots is coming back into the public consciousness)</p>

<p>I remember remarking a few years back that the crappiness of the economy seemed to correlate with the earliness of Christmas (or to be PC, “Holiday”) sales. If that holds up, we’re in the toilet, as the sales started around Halloween this year.</p>

<p>I’ll end this on the thought that I’d rather the “Holiday season” be about spending time with family and charitable works than an ad-hyped spend-yourself-to-the-dole-queue orgy of greed and gift arms race. That’s what all these holidays are supposed to be about, right? Christmas is about a figurative birth of a way of life, Hannukah is about maintaining a way of life in the face of oppression, Kwanzaa (… <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2207163/">is a made up holiday</a>, as they all are), but is about culture and unity, and Yule is the end of one cycle and the beginning of another. Drop the greed, do a good deed, and have a happy new year!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>To sum up before I even begin: they *suck*.</p>

<p>One of Java’s exceptionally weak points is serial and parallel interfaces, since it’s not within the normal bundled class library specification. In developing for Linux systems, I found that there are two basic routes you can take, being <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/javacomm/">Java Communications API</a> and <a href="http://users.frii.com/jarvi/rxtx/">RXTX</a>, with the latter being a reimplementation/extension of the former. To say that these are painful to work with doesn’t adequately state the gravity of the situation.</p>

<p>For example, the <em>javax.comm.properties</em> file needed by both libraries has to exist in the classpath or buried deep in the JRE. This is an offshoot of the issue that they require JNI libraries to function, which debian handles nicely in the form of a librxtx-java package which does most of the heavy lifting with the exception of that nasty properties file. In dealing with a J2EE app, this becomes a pain if you want to stick with the “single file” WAR deployment. Eventually I baked an additional instruction into my build.xml file to relocate the properties file on execution.</p>

<p>The documentation for rxtx, at least in terms of practical examples, is horrid. The wiki server isn’t up and running (at least when I went to look) and the only evidence that anyone had ever tried to use this library for the purposes I was looking to use it for were a few old javadocs and a handful of mailing list entries.</p>

<p>This really should *not* be this painful. Virtually every system targeted by the JRE has I/O devices which should be covered by the scope of the basic class libraries. I should not have to practically reinvent the wheel simply to push data out to a peripheral.</p>

<p>By the look of the documentation, this wouldn’t have been any easier doing it with Windows, and I believe I managed to kill its ability to be cross-platform in any meaningful sense when I decided to use RXTX. This is just as bad as those asshats who make completely crossplatform applications then tie them intrinsically to Windows in some completely brain-dead way for no apparent reason.</p>

<p>Hey Sun, when you made this specification, could you have possibly thought to include support for devices which have been around since <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RS-232">1969</a> …</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’ve been in the process of teaching myself the Google Android platform over the last few weeks, as my work has had a contest devoted to creating a mobile phone app, with a prize attached. I’m the only entrant who doesn’t work in the Engineering department, so this is a bit of a professional stretch for me as far as my job is concerned.</p>

<p>I have found quite a few caveats in the development process which are worth noting, as I have spent a fair amount of time researching them to figure them out. (I should also note at this point that this is in no way downplaying the important role Android plays in the future of mobile phone platforms, and is definitely *not* advocating either WinMo, which is a horrible abortion of a platform, or iPhone, which is not only locked to a single vendor, but *requires* purchasing a Crapitosh for development as well as a minimum 99$ development license to get going …)</p>

<p>1) <strong>Camera Access</strong> – It took some digging to find that you have to allow permission android.permission.CAMERA, or else it’ll throw out of memory errors and crash the app. I think it’s a running bug that in Android 1.6 it isn’t throwing a proper “PermissionDeniedException” or whatever else they feel like calling it. Otherwise the Camera API is pretty powerful.</p>

<p>2) <strong>Getting your own phone number</strong> – This is very interesting, as Android just moved to using something called “TelephonyManager” to deal with all of this. Unfortunately documentation hasn’t quite caught up to it. An example:</p>

<pre><code>TelephonyManager mTelephonyMgr = (TelephonyManager)context.getSystemService(Context.TELEPHONY_SERVICE); 
String imei = mTelephonyMgr.getDeviceId(); 
String phoneNumber=mTelephonyMgr.getLine1Number(); 
String country = mTelephonyMgr.getNetworkCountryISO(); 
</code></pre>

<p>3) <strong>Saving state</strong> – If you want to save state for your app, it makes no sense to go any further than SharedPreferences. It keeps you from having to create a content provider to deal with keeping that information stored somewhere else …</p>

<p>4) <strong>AppWidgets are awesome</strong> — The idea of a “home screen” applet is really easy to implement simply by extending AppWidgetProvider and add a  XML element to the AndroidManifest.xml file corresponding with the class.</p>

<p>5) <strong>Opening an intent from a menu item</strong> – The documentation says to use *a* Context, but doesn’t mention that you should be passing the Activity subclass that you’re coding to use as the Context.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For those who don’t know much about my life or daily habits, I have to commute into Framingham, Massachussets most days for work, which is about an hour drive from Northeast Connecticut, where I live. Unfortunately, this means spending a fair amount of time in traffic, as well as on the <a href="http://www.masspike.com/">Mass Pike</a>, which is the sorry excuse for mass transit across Massachussets. Americans think of mass transit as highways instead of rail and its compatriots, for one reason or another.</p>

<p>Getting on or off that road is a little dangerous — drivers in Massachussetts, less-than affectionately referred to as ‘<a href="http://www.masshole.com/">Massholes</a>‘ by drivers in other states, seem to have some hideous mental block which keeps them from being able to merge into traffic. A single lane merge on the Mass Pike can backup traffic for miles on some days. Instead of following the customary turn-taking merge technique which has become so commonplace in other parts of the country, drivers in the “Make it yours” state just slam their heavy feet down on the accelerator and attempt to cut off every other driver on the road.</p>

<p>It struck me that this is a pretty decent metaphor for the issues with the illusion of “pure capitalism” mentality that has become so prevalent in this country. Common sense dictates that by not being rude to your countrymen and displaying common courtesy, everyone does better. You may get to work a few minutes later, or possibly everyone could get to work on time. People don’t need to step on other people to get ahead — they can still get where they’re going, but it’s far better for everyone involved to not be such a dick about it.</p>

<p>And the second part of the metaphor is that if we just went with mass transit, we’d probably be better off, but no one is going to do it because we can’t show anyone our large shiny chrome and plastic wangs. Sadly, that might be the more apropos part of the metaphor.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As I have been delving deeper into the J2EE Servlet specification during the rewrite of <a href="http://remitt.org/">REMITT</a>, I have been learning some very interesting, and sometimes very painful, lessons about trying to package something without requiring complicated installations.</p>

<p>To get authentication working in Tomcat, the normal way is to define a Context and Realm in TOMCAT_HOME/conf/server.xml. A relatively undocumented file called META-INF/context.xml allows fragments to be distributed with war files. This would be a great solution if it didn’t mean that authentication was now deeply dependent on editing a file in the web archive, which kind of takes the advantage completely out of having one. D’oh!</p>

<p>Next up was the idea of using JAAS, which is a way of setting all of the security information in a single configuration file, and using a custom security module. Which would work very well, if I wanted to pre-extract the war file and pass an archaic system property file through JAVA_OPTS. This seems, again, too difficult to make any sort of sense.</p>

<p>I eventually found a solution by creating my own <a href="http://svn.freemedsoftware.org/remitt/trunk/src/org/remitt/server/jaas/SecurityFilter.java">Filter</a> and <a href="http://svn.freemedsoftware.org/remitt/trunk/src/org/remitt/server/jaas/HttpLoginModule.java">LoginModule</a>, then setting the system property for the <a href="http://svn.freemedsoftware.org/remitt/trunk/war/WEB-INF/login.conf">JAAS configuration</a> manually in the init() portion of the Filter. A little filter and realm information in <a href="http://svn.freemedsoftware.org/remitt/trunk/war/WEB-INF/web.xml">WEB-INF/web.xml</a>, and everything seems to work somehow. I understand that the Servlet guys wanted to make sure that the J2EE server context and app context were at two different levels (hence the reason a DataSource in META-INF/context.xml or tomcat’s conf/server.xml isn’t writeable at all), but it makes it a mess for clean deployment.</p>

<p>As it stands now, I can run the server with an override file like like:<br />
<code>JAVA_OPTS="-Dproperties=/my/remitt.properties" ./bin/catalina.sh start</code></p>

<p>And I think that’s worth the hassle to set up, since it makes deployment a breeze.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I think one of the biggest things that keeps America from moving forward is the intellecually bankrupt notion that people exist independently of one another, and that each person is independently financially responsible for their entire life. It’s a horrible concept, which was promulgated, at least in part, by Ayn Rand and her followers. I quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>In answer to the question: “If a morality is not based on the common good, what is it then based on?”: on a definition of the moral individual and on that which is good for him. The moral individual is the best and highest possible to man. By what standard? By the essence of man’s nature. The man living in accordance with his nature is the moral man and the “surviving” man — he carries the life force, the life principle, he is the self-renewing “energy” and the fountainhead. What is man’s nature? Man is a reasoning being.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>And since morality is a matter of free will, open to all but the insane — the good of the moral man is good for all, i.e., for all those who wish to be moral.</p>

  <p>What is good? That which is in accordance with the life principle of man. The independent, the self-reverent, the self-sufficient.</p>

  <p>Do I set myself up as an arbitrary elite and formulate a morality for my own kind of elite, at the expense of others? No, because it is not to be enforced upon “others” or anyone. “Others” are free not to accept it and not to subscribe to it; they may have their own kind of collectivism, altruism or whatever they wish. But they are not free to enforce it upon me and my “elite” — they are not free to arrange their collectivism at our expense. The objective dividing line is: no man exists for the sake of another man. […]</p>

  <p>This point — no man exists for the sake of another man — must be established very early in my system. It is one of the main cornerstones — and perhaps even the basic axiom.</p>

  <p>Quoted from the Journals of Ayn Rand</p>

  <p>Where do I start with where this goes wrong? I guess I could start with “What is good? That which is in accordance with the life principal of man. The independent, the self-reverent, the self-sufficient.” It’s a very narcissistic point of view, assuming that people exist solely for themselves. Wikipedia refers to a community as a “group that is organized around common values and social cohesion within a shared geographical location, generally in social units larger than a household”. Common values and social cohesion infer interdependencies between the persons involved, ostensibly in the aspiration toward a higher common good. Whereas no person exists solely for the sake of another person, a web of interdependency links all of us, and what is good for one person in particlar is rarely good for society in general.</p>

  <p>Now we can move on to the rich, or the “parasite class”. I tend to think of money as <a href="http://www.chrismartenson.com/crashcourse/chapter-6-what-money">a claim on human labor</a>, as per Chris Martenson. The issue with the incredible wage disparity that we see in our system of “pure capitalism” (which is quite debatable, as we have been <a href="http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2009/01/cbo-64-billion-subsidy-cost-for-tarp.html">injecting public funds for private gain as of late</a>), is that the labors of the highest paid echelon of society could not possibly be justified over the laborers of the lowest.</p>

  <p>Lawyers, for example, have no cap on the amount of money they can charge (I prefer to use the more fitting word “extort”) their clients, mainly because they not only control rich and powerful lobbys, but also because the <a href="http://www.senate.gov/CRSReports/crs-publish.cfm?pid='0DP%2BP,[;#">majority of lawmakers are lawyers</a>. You not only can’t trust rich people to regulate crookery, you really can’t trust people to regulate themselves. I swear, it really doesn’t work. I’m sure that for the lawyer involved in a case, charging 500 dollars an hour seems like it makes a great deal of sense from a personal standpoint, as he or she can advance their lifestyle through the acquisition of enormous piles of cash-money, but society as a whole does not benefit from this behavior. For example, people filing for bankruptcy generally don’t have a few thousand dollars laying around to hand to some lawyer who is just going to have his lowly paralegal do the majority of the work, then bill it at his normal rate. Did I forget to mention that profit-sharing of legal fees with non-bar certified professionals (non-lawyers) isn’t legal, as the lawyers in Congress have written laws to ensure that? Must be nice to make your own rules…</p>

  <p>Back to individualism, and why it’s such a crock. The majority of the services that an average American uses during the day are in some way, shape or form at least somewhat community owned or controlled. Roads and sewers are owned and operated by the communities in which they are located. Police, fire and ambulance servers are, in all but the most far-fetched cases, owned and operated by municipalities. Public power infrastructure is maintained by states and to a lesser degree municipalities. Healthcare over a certain age, at least in theory, is spread out over the community as a whole, as a way of supporting our elderly citizens.</p>

  <p>Calling all of this “socialism” is probably right. The greater issue is “what is wrong with socialism?” The answer lies in the inability for a small percentage (which would otherwise be a statistical anomaly) of people to claw their way into an utterly lavish lifestyle by using the labor of less fortunate (or most likely, more scrupulous) people to get there.</p>

  <p>Then there is the moral premise of the entire Randian argument — whatever is good for you, is obviously better than what is good for everyone, because you’re more important than everyone else. People who are rich generally get that way by making profit on some sort of labor or time investment (discounting the <a href="http://existentialistcowboy.blogspot.com/2009/08/why-us-investor-class-are-blood-sucking.html">parasite “investor class”</a>, which makes money solely by leveraging existing money in a corrupt system which leans towards investment over labor). The issue with that is that draining an inordinate amount of money out of the economy as a whole, for the sole purpose of greed and self-aggrandizement, is detrimental to the people who are actually performing the labor and consuming the services in question. A healthy income can still be derived from personal labors without the upward motion of wealth from the actual laborers working underneath the person or people in question. Therefore, being rich implies being greedy.</p>

  <p>When I say “rich”, I don’t mean those people who have gone to school for ten years to get a degree and earn 100,000 dollars a year or more. I mean the people who are dragging in 200,000 or even 500,000 dollars a year. I can’t conscionably see how anyone can produce labor that is worth that kind of money (at least in 2009 dollars).</p>

  <p>The bottom line is that rich people are different from pretty much everyone else. Hoping you’re going to be the asshole on top raining golden showers of delight on the happy plebes below is a terrible reason to push destructive policies and strip back social measures designed to keep people safe and healthy. Taxing the rich at a higher percentage isn’t unfair, it’s just evening the playing field, restoring community “wealth” back to the community and the people who actually produced the wealth. Go socialism?</p>
