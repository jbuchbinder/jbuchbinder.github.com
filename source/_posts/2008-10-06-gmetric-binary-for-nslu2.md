Before a friend clued me in to the [embedded gmetric][1] project, I had needed to strip out just the gmetric binary for use in monitoring a process on the NSLU2 I was using.

So, for anyone who is interested, I have posted both a [binary ipkg package][2] for OpenSLUG/BE and a [source package][3] containing all of the pieces I yanked from the ganglia 3.1.1 distribution to create it. (Graciously hosted by [mediafire.com][4]â€¦) Hopefully this can be of use to someone.
