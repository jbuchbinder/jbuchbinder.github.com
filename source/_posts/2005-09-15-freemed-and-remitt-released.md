I have released the FreeMED 0.8.0 and REMITT 0.3 combination, along with phpwebtools 0.4.5. I’ve found that [Subversion][1] rapidly decreases my development time, as it allows me to focus more on the programming and less on [annoying problems][2]. I have also been working on some of Irv’s ideas regarding [secure data warehousing][3], and the next version of FreeMED should support that “out of the box”, without the need to configure anything complicated.
