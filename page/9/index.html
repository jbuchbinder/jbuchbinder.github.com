  <div class="entry-content"><h1 id="section"></h1>

<p>Amid news of the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/companyNews/idUSN2533674620080425">overcompensated fatcat</a> of General Motors heading over to Capitol Hill to prostrate himself at the feet of House Speaker Pelosi to beg for some of that sweet, sweet bailout money, without admitting that <a href="http://www.beggarscanbechoosers.com/2008/11/despite-gms-staggering-losses-ceo-still.html">the pure capitalism he pimped to support his outrageous salary is now effectively dead,</a> I see that Chief Financial Rape Artist Hank Paulson has just thrown another <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/11/09/AR2008110902155_pf.html">140 billion dollars</a> into the rabbit hole of non-accountability. This GM thing caught my attention for a reason; after a bit of “persuasion”, Speaker Pelosi is now on the floor of the House begging for her fellow legislators to <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aKCvSSaWPdUE">throw the fuckers a bone</a>.</p>

<p>This is the same GM that has been dumping SUVs on the market in a time when <a href="http://www.theautochannel.com/news/2004/08/12/208770.html">people aren’t buying them</a>. The downturn in demand was reported in *2004*. I can’t honestly believe that there’s an issue with the idiots at GM understanding that, but more that they believe that they don’t have anything to change. They want to keep doing what they’re doing, and probably <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/10/28/business/sorkin.php">lay off a load of people who, as taxpayers, would be financing their operation.</a> In case 2004 seems a bit familiar to some people, it was the year that same company <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/08/23/1093113104906.html?from=storyrhs">unveiled a multi fuel car</a>. Why, you ask, was I unaware of this? Because they did it in *Brazil*. Not here, but *Brazil*.</p>

<p>Much as horse and buggy whip companies fell under the wheels of progress as the automobile came to prominence, so must GM go under. They’re a dinosaur, which needs to be replaced with smaller lither companies which are interested in doing things other than churning out gas-guzzling monsters.</p>

<p>If a company the size of GM moved to electric vehicles, I would think that they would storm the industry and revolutionize American transportation. But that’s not the kind of forward thinking we’re seeing from one of the best paid CEOs in the industry. No, it’s all “stay the course.” I can swear I remember <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/03/17/bush.terror/">another chief executive</a> saying that, and I don’t think it went too well.</p>

<p>I know Pelosi hasn’t been getting great press, what with Congress’s <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/107242/congress-approval-rating-ties-lowest-gallup-records.aspx">horrific approval ratings</a>, but feeding money to these guys is just plain *retarded*. I mean, if we’re going to find a company worth saving, I don’t think it would be these guys, especially with their record of CEO Wagoner flaunting his huge salary as being “well earned” while his company lost billions of dollars.</p>

<p>I guess the legacy of the W presidency will be one of giving as much money as possible on the way out. I’m being witness to possibly the largest heist in *history*. These guys are walking off with money after having made horrific decisions, just because Americans can’t live with the idea of a (gasp) Recession, or even (horrors) Depression after we’ve been living off bubbles since Ronnie “Iron Curtain Smashing Cock” Reagan was in office.</p>

<p>It’s kind of funny to watch the fuckers on Bloomberg TV talk about how this is all “in our heads”, and that everything is the fault of skittish investors, as though the actual state of the market has nothing to do with the actual *money* that people have in there. The majority of Americans don’t have money to kick around like that.</p>

<p>Fuck GM. They’ve fucked up in a horrible, horrible way, and are now coming crying to the same people they have been laughing at for years, asking with tears in their eyes and outstretched hands for some of that sweet, sweet money from your unborn grandchildren. Die, GM. It’s about time.</p>

<p><em>Postscript: For the math…. GM wants 25,000,000,000 USD (25 billion dollars). Estimates range to about 150,000 jobs which would probably be lost if GM went belly up. Assuming that not a single GM car would be sold, they could continue to make payroll for over 3 years if the average pay of an actual GM worker was 50,000 USD a year. I’m sure they’re not getting paid that much, but assuming that … If the Feds mandated a complete changing of the guard in their useless management caste and also forced a new direction towards more fuel efficient vehicles and/or electric vehicles which are affordable for average Americans, there would be a serious chance of real change instead of the status quo. I’m not going to be holding my breath for it, though.</em></p>

<p>I’ve been watching all available polling today after I hit the polls around 8:30 AM EST to cast my vote. I’m a little nervous watching the polling numbers, and everything is just a little too close for my comfort.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1 id="section"></h1>

<p>Well, that’s it. At around 11pm EST, Senator John McCain conceded the presidency to Senator Barack Obama. All of my fears of stolen elections and bigotry prevailing were unfounded. And I owe someone a lunch, but gladly so.</p>

<p>After listening to a few pundits on TV and McCain’s concession speech, I have noticed that everyone keeps harping on Senator Obama’s race. I just find it difficult to believe that we’re so proud of our ability to not trip over our bigotry enough to elect someone who isn’t white. Get over yourselves. We’re supposed to be an *adult* nation, so try to act like one. Don’t boo the winner when you’ve been supporting the loser, even six year olds know better. I’m also amazed that every major news channel made this thing out to be a contest, when it was pretty much decided in the Democratic primary. I mean, I think the Republican brand is dogfood at this point… Strauss should be appropriately spinning in his grave.</p>

<p>On to energy independence and the end of warmongering, perhaps? Perhaps even some universal healthcare. But as Bill Cosby pointed out, it’s not enough for Senator Obama to be a decent president, he’s going to have to be far better and far greater, otherwise it would doom any other non-caucasian presidential hopefuls.</p>

<p>Now, if only I could get one of those sweet “O”-bama hats. I really want one, and now I can’t find one on his store …</p>

<p>In case anyone was wondering, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/oct/17/executivesalaries-banking">we’ve been had</a>, in an awful, awful way, to the tune of around 70 *billion* dollars. And as pointed out on Cronytopia, <a href="http://chris-floyd.com/component/content/article/3/1631-cronytopia-what-the-world-knows-and-americans-dont-about-the-bailout.html">US newspapers aren’t covering it</a>.</p>

<p>Why aren’t we burning people in the streets, right now? I mean, I understand that the bailout passed by an overwhelming majority, but why were we so glad to give such a large amount of money to people that we shouldn’t trust raking manure, let alone running financial institutions?</p>

<p>Personally, I’m not giving a damn cent to investment bankers. They’ve scammed enough money away with the promise of “we’ll increase the amount of money you’ve got.” Screw the stock market. Let the well off people throw their money down that particular rat-hole. These people are off counting their money while our economy burns.</p>

<p>Can *anyone* please justify how we’re actually letting this happen? I can’t think of anyone apart from their MBA-holding compatriots in crime, who are anxiously hoping for some of that sweet, sweet socialized bailout money so they can also own a few chateaus… Fuck ‘em.</p>

<p>For all those fans of the venerable <a href="http://www.nslu2-linux.org/">NSLU2</a> (or “slug” as we like to call it), I have another package for OpenSlug/BE. This time it’s <a href="http://lpccomp.bc.ca/remserial/">remserial</a>, a Linux equivalent to the BSD “<a href="http://www.bsdua.org/netfwd.html">netfwd</a>” software, allowing serial ports to be redirected over TCP.</p>

<p>Package: <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?sznttmgdi2c">remserial_0.2000-1_armv5b.ipk</a><br />

<p>For those enterprising people who would like to use my <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?nmmwztgj5it">armv5b-softfloat-linux</a> cross compilation toolchain, I have made it available on <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/">mediafire</a> as well. It was compiled with Ubuntu 8.04.1 i386, so that’s the safest bet to use for compilation. I had used the NSLU2 “master makefile” to build it, since the vanilla crosstool had provided me little in terms of usable toolchains for the NSLU2.</p>

<p><em>(Again, apologies to the people I stole the title from, the nice guys over at <a href="http://www.crooksandliars.com/">crooksandliars.com</a>.)</em></p>

<p>Every time I think I’ve heard the most awful thing done by religious people…</p>

<p>In the same day, I’ve heard two stories coming from the Catholic Church. Yes, I know, the guys who did the whole “inquisition” thing. But they’ve been keeping their noses clean since at least the 1950s, so I’ll start this off by pointing out that I don’t have any beef with the modern day Catholic Church. They don’t come knocking on my door like <a href="http://www.bible.ca/jw.htm">other pointless suit-festooned fuckers</a> or <a href="http://samuraimohel.wordpress.com/2008/03/26/messianic-jewish-hate-campaign-against-real-jews-in-full-swing/">pray for me to go to hell</a>, so we’re on pretty good terms.</p>

<p>But now I get to hear about a twelve time child molester priest, who, despite violating at least twelve children, is <a href="http://www.courant.com/news/local/statewire/hc-07070848.apds.m0962.bc-ct--prieoct07,0,4449400.story">still a damn priest</a>, is finally asked by *police* to come in to face charges. What the hell is wrong with the Church on this one? Isn’t shielding a child molester simply fueling accusations that all priests are kiddie-fuckers? I mean, come on, you’re seriously screwing up in the P.R. department on this one. If the guy were a school teacher and was caught with his jimmy in a fifth grader, I would think that he would never work again, and more than likely would have *awful* things happen to him in prison. This guy has been doing this stuff for *years* and just gets moved around. Must be nice to be in J.C.’s posse.</p>

<p>The second point is the <a href="http://www.courant.com/news/nationworld/wire/sns-ap-eu-vatican-pius-xii,0,7223261.story">whitewashing of Pope Pius XII</a> of any sort of culpability in the holocaust. He didn’t exactly hold open the doors of the gas chamber, but by most accounts he <a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/anti-semitism/pius.html">did absolutely nothing</a>. Now, I’m not sure exactly how far the criteria for becoming a Saint has fallen, but I’m sure letting people die isn’t exactly one of the prerequisites for it. I mean, <a href="http://www.americancatholic.org/Features/teresa/Sainthood.asp">Mother Teresa</a> has had a long road to it, after having spent many years tending to sick people. Pius let a total of <a href="http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h1677.html">between 10 and 26 million people die</a> during the Nazi’s reign — and he gets to be a Saint?</p>

<p>I know Ratzinger was in the <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article382076.ece">Official Hitler Fan Club</a>, but isn’t this a little much? His excuse for not having shot anyone as a Nazi Youth was an “infected finger.” Not that he didn’t want to, not that he objected, that he had a <em>bad finger</em>. At least <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_John_Paul_II">the last guy</a> actually improved things when he was pope, and in fact issued an apology for the exact thing that Ratzinger is trying to promote the sainthood for: <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/religion/jan-june98/vatican_4-8.html">doing jack squat during the holocaust</a>… and maybe a little <a href="http://www.fantompowa.net/Flame/the_vatican.htm">money laundering</a>. Who let this particular joker be pope, anyways?</p>

<p>I think the Vatican kinda needs to get its act together. I’d rather go back to laughing and pointing at stupid sex scandals and child molestation in <a href="http://www.watchtowerinformationservice.org/childabuse.htm">much lower hanging fruit</a> than having to see a 2000 year old institution made a laughing stock by poor leadership. Well, Ratzinger, ball’s in your court. Don’t make the Jewish guy on the cross cry any more than you have to.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1 id="section"></h1>

<p>Recently, you may have heard about certain <a href="http://tpmelectioncentral.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/09/obsession_dvd_distributors_wer.php">alarmist crap</a> being circulated in the guise of educational information to people in so called “swing states” in the upcoming 2008 election. Usually this crap doesn’t get an audience, but some of the kooks have been coming out of the woodwork, bitching at the top of their lungs about “islamic fundamentalism” and terrorist, and “oh! think of the children!”</p>

<p>Some people already think that the September 11, 2001 attacks were <a href="http://erlenda5.blogspot.com/">false flag</a> attacks, but regardless, it couldn’t have played better. We have a long and illustrious <a href="http://social.infowars.com/blog_entry.php?user=ericdubay&amp;blogentry_id=4945">history</a> of taking the stupid reaction to anything bad happening. Look as far back as the Revolutionary War or any of the conflicts with Native Americans. Demonize the other guys, we get to be the good guys, who can argue with that?</p>

<p>The United States could have cared less about World War II until the Pearl Harbor attack … and even then America wasn’t involved in WWII because of Nazi atrocities, but more because we wanted to kill Japanese people (and all of their colleagues), to “put right” the attack on Pearl Harbor.</p>

<p>Even before the end of WWII, we were already focused on the “new evil”, being Stalin’s USSR. For years, “communists” were “them” and “capitalists” were us, despite our habit of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_Chilean_coup_d'état">disposing democracies</a> in favor of dictatorships depending on their supposed strategic worth. The most important part of this was that most people hadn’t met a “communist”, but were willing to blame all of their problems on them, to the point of holding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCarthyism">witch trials</a>.</p>

<p>But the next generation of hatred started with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_hostage_crisis">Iranian hostage crisis</a>, when we decided that the guys in the middle east were a good target for us to hate. In the last ten years or so, guys like the <a href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Project_for_the_New_American_Century">PNAC</a> have been pushing for us to assert our American way over the supposed “savages”. Reminds you of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crusade">another time</a>, doesn’t it? Be afraid of the scary dark people, they’ll chop your heads off and blow up your buildings!</p>

<p>Of course, those don’t hold any more water than saying that the KKK is an accurate representation of Christianity, but it doesn’t even slow down the fearmongering. It’s just amazing that we’re all so xenophobic and hatefilled that we have to blame all of the world’s problems on a group of people we don’t understand very well. Economy sucks? Must be the blacks and the Muslims! Thinking of voting for something a little different for president? If you do, the blacks and the Muslims will get you! (We can always blame “the minorities” for everything, but we’re obviously not racist because we have at least one friend from that minority.)</p>

<p>This is the kind of thing that makes me <a href="http://james.lab6.com/2007/01/05/racism-and-nationalism-are-the-same-thing">hate Nationalism</a>, and <a href="http://www.adequacy.org/stories/2001.7.19.83250.1989.html">hate sports teams</a>. It’s all the same concept as racism, after all. Divide people up with artificial distinctions, and give yourself a reason to dislike people.</p>

<p>But it’s amazing how the herd instinct is so powerful in is that it keeps us from looking out for our own good. Look at the number of <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9a03e4d81639f93ba25752c0a9629c8b63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all">people who voted for Bush in 2004 because they were afraid</a> of terrorism. Mind you, people have been doing terrorist-like things here for years, but <a href="http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/notorious/mcveigh/dawning_1.html?print=yes">white Christian guys doing the same thing</a> apparently isn’t the same thing. Or maybe we can’t tell by his face that he isn’t one of “us”.</p>

<p>There are already a number of attempts to <a href="http://rawstory.com/news/2008/For_campaigns_now_its_personal_1006.html">equate one of the Presidential candidates with terrorism</a> (them). It’s crap, of course, since all of the attacks have been <a href="http://216.87.173.33/media/2008/0810/msnbc_ko_comment_palin_terrorists_081006a.flv">debunked ad nauseum</a>, but when has that ever stopped “us” from going after “them”? I would have been more upset with the other guy talking about <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jared-bernstein/the-most-important-piece_b_101237.html">the death of social services</a>, since that affects people, but what do I know? People actually living with the assistance of social programs still vote Republican — I have no idea why, but they do.</p>

<p>The thing I worry about is that <a href="http://library.thinkquest.org/C004367/eh4.shtml">social darwinism</a> is a crock of crap, as is pure capitalism. But we’re operating on the idea that the possible worst case scenarios, “welfare queens” (which is code for “black”, even though no one really wants to use that word) are a fringe, not the majority, but somehow that has eeked its way into the public consciousness. Why should we, as honest hard-working Americans, pay to support other people? Because we’re going to be paying for some sort of programs, and I guess its up to us whether we’re paying for Wall Street execs or people who actually *need* the money. Or war, we can spend it on war…</p>

<p>Please, everyone, don’t vote with a herd mentality. It hurts my head to think that people are that petty and stupid.</p>
