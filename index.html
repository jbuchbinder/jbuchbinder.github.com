  <div class="entry-content"><p>Failing is a terrible thing, we are taught. As a result of inherent cognitive biases and our own illusory superiority (look up the <a href="http://www.spring.org.uk/2012/06/the-dunning-kruger-effect-why-the-incompetent-dont-know-theyre-incompetent.php">Dunning-Kruger effect</a>, if you’re curious about this), we believe that we are right the majority of times, that we are more skilled than those around us, and that we have nothing of import to learn from not succeeding.</p>

<p>I’m going to uncharacteristically detour into a quick anecdote. I was attending a film festival a little while ago, and had ended up talking to one of the festival’s organizers. She had asked me about how I got into film, and talked a little bit about some of her own projects. After a while, I mentioned how I learned more from my failures than I did from my successes. She stopped the line of conversion, and said that she didn’t, because she “always” succeeded.</p>

<p>There’s a lesson to be learned from her. If you never fail (or never allow yourself to be put in a situation when you fail, or never accept that you have failed), you aren’t going to be able to examine your process to figure out how you can improve. If we’re at the height of our skill set at the present moment, I view that assessment as a dismal failure; we should always expect that, given time and effort, we should continue to improve as time goes on.</p>

<p>I don’t necessarily <em>hate</em> everything I’ve done in past projects, but can instead view my previous work as evolutionary improvement. Every project I do should be the best work I’ve done <em>so far</em>, and if it isn’t, I should be taking steps to make sure that the next one is.</p>

<h2 id="understanding-failure-and-criticism">Understanding Failure and Criticism</h2>

<p>We do not accept criticism well – especially not as artists. Most of our work is, to some degree, very personal. We then view attacks on our work as attacks on some part of ourselves, and become much more defensive than we should be.</p>

<p><strong>Cognitive bias</strong> is a serious issue with us accepting criticism, or any differing points of view from our own. Without getting into too much detail about the mechanics of cognitive bias, it is important to emphasize the importance of recognizing that we all possess it, to one degree or another.</p>

<p><strong>High expectations</strong> tends to result in a feeling of having failed at a much deeper level than the project at hand. A very insightful person had written (about film festival contests, in particular) that you had to be committed to making the best thing you could, not winning. It may not sound like a lot of inherent difference, but stripping your expectations for a project can allow you to be much more free in your ability to execute that project.</p>

<p><strong>People who criticize or critique can help you.</strong> Every failure which is left without analysis is a missed opportunity. You cannot learn from your missteps and mistakes without looking at them with a critical eye. A third party with less vested interest in you and your project can give you the perspective you need to improve.</p>

<h2 id="post-mortem-analyses">Post Mortem Analyses</h2>

<p>I come from a pretty heavy information technology background, and one of the favorite “failure analysis” tools we tend to use after something breaks is something called a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmortem_documentation">post mortem</a>, which is short for “post mortem documentation”. It involves a rigorous process of analyzing key elements which were responsible for both successful and unsuccessful aspects of a project or event.</p>

<p>For example, I performed both a post mortem on our <a href="/2014/05/07/48-hours-with-the-blackmagic-production-camera-4k/">2014 48 Hour Boston Festival project</a>, which documented some of the things I learned about working with a new camera body, as well as working under tight time constraints, and a post mortem on our <a href="/2014/11/07/winning-a-48-hour-film-project/">2014 48 Hour Providence Horror Festival project</a>, which took home a number of awards, including “Best Film”. Even the analysis of our <strong>successful</strong> project found issues which needed to be addressed before our next project.</p>

<h2 id="your-worst-critic">Your Worst Critic</h2>

<p>… is you (or at least, it should be). You need to be the harshest critic you have.</p>

<p>The rationale I give for this is that you cannot rely on those intrinsically involved in either your professional or personal life, who all have some sort of stake in how well you do something, to be critical enough of what you do. If you can’t expect complete, harsh honesty from those around you – then <em>you</em> are going to have to try to be as harsh as possible with what you’re putting out.</p>

<p><em>(Yes, I’m aware that the younger generation has been indoctrinated, to a certain point, with the notion that everything they do is the best, most awesome, most <strong>EPIC</strong> thing that any human being has ever done – but if you want to succeed artistically, you’ve got to overcome that.)</em></p>

<h2 id="avoid-negativity">Avoid Negativity</h2>

<p>Failure doesn’t have to be a negative thing. Any experience from which we learn a valuable lesson or draw potential improvement from should not be a negative experience. Much like the rest of life, this isn’t the end product of what you’re capable of. It isn’t the last, greatest thing you do – unless, of course, you become disheartened and stop producing things.</p>

<p>Stay positive, learn from your successes <strong>and</strong> your failures – and good luck!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My team, <a href="http://www.shootthemoonfilms.com/">Shoot the Moon Films</a>, won the
2014 Providence Horror Film Project’s “Best Picture” award, as well as scoring
a “Best Actor” award for <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3895408/">Nicholas Magrey</a>, a “Best Writing” award for
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5720821/">Natasha Darius</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3895408/">Nicholas Magrey</a>, and a “Best Sound Design” award for
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6854894/">Aaron Theodore Berton</a> for our short film
“<a href="http://www.facebook.com/TheCarving">The Carving</a>” (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4131910/">IMDb</a>).</p>

<div class="embed-video-container"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/l4OQm1J0F0w "></iframe></div>

<p>I’m used to doing post-mortem analyses on failures, so this is a fairly
unusual task ; why did “The Carving” win against other films – especially
against some very strong contenders?</p>

<h2 id="its-all-about-the-story">It’s all about the story.</h2>

<p>As usual, we didn’t base our story off of any pre-existing concepts, scripts,
etc. Although it is expressly forbidden in the rules of the 48 hour film
projects, it is common knowledge that many teams engage in this practice,
presumably because of the difficulty of producing a good screenplay in the
alloted time.</p>

<p>I’m always proud of our writers, and this was no exception. When you’re
writing a story which has to come out as a four to seven minute short, you
can’t write an over-complicated concept, or take a half hour concept and
cut it down to a few minutes of film. We had used a fairly complicated
concept for our last 48 hour effort, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3713362/">Desire</a>,
and it did not fare very well.</p>

<p>It helps to have writers who know basic tenets of writing, and there are
a ton of online courses, books, and general help to improve scripts. Without
the screenwriters, we would not have won.</p>

<h2 id="sound-is-important-too">Sound is important, too.</h2>

<p>We spend an inordinate amount of post production time on ADR-ing, Foley-ing,
and otherwise enjoying the hard work of our sound engineer, which resulted
in the best <strong>sounding</strong> audio track of any of the films in the festival.
(Don’t take my word for it – it won an award specifically for that.)</p>

<p>Your boom operator has to be paying attention, and your audio setup has to
be… something. Don’t rely on a single source of audio, either. We had an
issue with a cable which resulted in having to use on-camera audio for a
closeup shot. This wouldn’t have been possible without a backup.</p>

<p>(It’s worth noting that in editing, I ended up doing as much audio replacement
as I could before handing off to our sound engineer, to cut down on the
amount of time which he’d have to burn finding the nicest audio for a certain
take.)</p>

<h2 id="take-footage-of-only-what-you-need-to-survive">Take (footage of) only what you need to survive.</h2>

<p>Overly fancy cinematography, while fun to execute (and great for winning
Cinematography awards), is nothing if it doesn’t help propel your story
forward. If you’re trying desperately to find a way to put a quadcopter
shot into your film, you may have lost already.</p>

<p>I’m a huge fan of indulgent, long, complicated shots – but they have to
fit your idiom. If you’re making a four to seven minute long short, you
probably shouldn’t do things just for the sake of doing them. A quick
example was that I had originally planned a jib/crane shot for a particular
piece of exposition, but ended up going with a snorricam rigged shot
instead. The snorricam doesn’t add as much “value” to the end product, but
it told the story <em>better</em>.</p>

<h2 id="on-the-other-hand-think-about-your-video-quality-a-bit">On the other hand, think about your video quality a bit.</h2>

<p>If you’re shooting on a handicam, why? Entry level DSLRs are cheap and
easy to come by, and with the right set of eyes behind the camera, they
can produce great footage.</p>

<p>If you’re not color correcting or grading your footage, why? The walls
behind your characters shouldn’t be changing between shots unless you
intend for them to be doing so. White balancing doesn’t cost any money.</p>

<p>If you’re not lighting your footage, why? A guy with a decent eye and
a few clamp lights can add immeasurable depth and character to your
shots. I know that “low light cinematography” is making the rounds as
the new fad, but you’re not going to get the same type of picture. It
doesn’t cost much (or anything if you already have the equipment at
home), so what’s the harm?</p>

<h2 id="if-you-cant-do-something-find-someone-who-can">If you can’t do something, find someone who can.</h2>

<p>Unless you’re a one person shop, consider finding other people to handle
tasks – especially if they’re better at something than you are. Get
someone with a good eye to handle the cinematography, someone who can
write well to pen your piece, and people who are good with audio to handle
your post production.</p>

<h2 id="dont-try-to-win-try-to-put-out-the-best-film-you-can">Don’t try to win, try to put out the best film you can.</h2>

<p>This is advice I had received right before the 48 started, and it’s some
of the best I’ve had. Because we specifically tried to make the best film
we could make in 48 hours (within the constraints outlined by the 48), we
have a film for our own promotion and uses after the festival ended.</p>

<p>Good luck to you in all of your cinematographic adventures!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Almost six months after the Boston 48 Hour Film Festival, my team
(<a href="http://www.shootthemoonfilms.com/">Shoot the Moon Films</a>) is entering the
2014 <a href="http://www.48hourfilm.com/providence/horror/2014/">Providence 48 Hour Horror Festival</a>. Along
with seventeen other teams, we’re going to try to make a 4-7 minute
horror film in 48 hours.</p>

<p>This is pretty far out of my wheelhouse, as I haven’t made a practice of
making horror films, but my team and I are excited, and I’m going to keep
track of both our successes and our missteps here.</p>

<h2 id="day-one-preproduction-kickoff-and-writing">Day One: Preproduction, Kickoff, and Writing</h2>

<p>The one crazy moment I ended up having before everything got started was
the realization that I didn’t have enough space on the primary editing
workstation drive – and I ended up ameliorating that by purchasing another
drive down the road. Crisis averted, no hair lost.</p>

<p>I don’t like the roads around Providence, which proved to be a pain both
heading out to the kickoff event (horrific traffic and rubbernecking) as well
as on the way back (incorrect signage sending me to take a nasty U-turn in
Providence). As our producer couldn’t make the trip to the kickoff event,
I ended up taking his place.</p>

<p>After a two or three story jaunt up a staircase in a pretty non-descript
mill building in Pawtucket, I joined a group of mostly younger filmmakers,
eager to pick a category and get moving. As this was a “horror” themed
festival, we had a list of genres – and the writers had asked that I not
request one of the contingency genres, as they were more difficult to pull
off.</p>

<p>The guy standing behind me, after telling me how much he hated “Found Footage”
as a genre (which, by the way, I also loathe), ended up pulling that genre.
We ended up getting “Satanic/Demonic Possession”, and I messaged the
information back to the writers, so that they could get started on the
planning and writing process before I got back.</p>

<p>Both of the writers were coming from previous engagements, including one
who was starring in a theater production of “Frankenstein”, the other who
had costumed and was doing hair and prep work – but they still
managed to crank out the final version of a script before midnight. Everyone,
cast and crew, got sent copies.</p>

<p>From midnight until about 2:00 - 2:30 a.m., I wrote out a tentative shot list
and printed a huge piles of copies of the script. I got to sleep a little
before 3:00 a.m.</p>

<h2 id="day-two-production--shooting">Day Two: Production / Shooting</h2>

<p>At around 6:00 a.m., my wife and I got up, packed all of the equipment into
the car, and met the rest of the cast and crew at our shooting location at
7:00 a.m. We ended up having to scramble around to get all of the set
dressing components for the set, and got production underway around 10:30 -
11:00 a.m. Shooting with the BMPC4K camera made shooting, in most instances,
much faster since we could shoot in 4K and simply “punch in” for close up
shots without losing resolution. It was a neat trick which had been suggested
to me about two years ago by the director of “Chez Upshaw”, which a project
of mine had screened with at BIFF.</p>

<p>I got a chance to trot out a snorricam rig which hadn’t been used in almost
two years. It couldn’t handle the weight of the production camera, so we
were using a Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera with a modified Computar 12.5mm
f/1.3 lens stopped down to about f/4 to replace the GoPro Hero 2 we used to
use. The footage is nicely inter-cuttable with the Production Camera footage,
so I wouldn’t have to pull any rabbits out of hats in color grading.</p>

<p>We had a hard deadline for wrapping up principal photography of 5:30 p.m.,
since a number of actors and crew members had to make it back to the theater
for another performance of “Frankenstein” – including two of our actors,
our production designer <em>and</em> our makeup artist. We barely finished our last
take of our last outside shot as it started to rain heavily outside. No
equipment damaged, no shot missed.</p>

<p>We had to return props, and since my wife had taken the car, our producer
loaded up half of the equipment and my friend Chris helped me with the rest
of it, as well as helping me return some of our borrowed props. Another cup
of coffee later, and we were transferring about 280+ GB of footage off of the
two cameras and the boom rig.</p>

<p>One of the actors and the producer took turns sitting with me while I made
the bulk of the edits. We finished the rough cut at a little past 11:50 p.m.
The cast and crew members present watched the rough cut to confirm that there 
weren’t any glaring issues with the cut, then my wife and I went through all
of the audio to catalogue shot numbers and takes for easy sound replacement
referencing. I rendered out a reference copy for the musician doing the
scoring, uploaded it, and went to sleep before I passed out on my keyboard.</p>

<h2 id="day-three-post-production-and-making-the-deadline">Day Three: Post-production and Making the Deadline</h2>

<p>After a brief hour and a half or so of sleep, I ended up having to get up
to help my geriatric dog, who has periodic breathing issues. I got another
hour or so of sleep before my wife tossed me out of bed, and I stumbled down
the street to grab a cup of delicious Peruvian coffee to wake up. I’m pretty
sure my eyes weren’t open until half way back to the house.</p>

<p>From 6:30 a.m. until 10:30 a.m., I did the bulk of the sound replacement and
matching work as well as the coloring in Resolve. I dumped out an export for
Audition to take with me for ADR, and headed off to get the few lines that
we needed done.</p>

<p>Five actors met me over at our original shoot location, primarily so that my
dogs wouldn’t scuttle any of the takes. We wrapped sound collection around
1:30 p.m., and headed back to recomposite everything. I sent out the audio
to our audio engineer in Massachussetts, who recomposited everything together
and cleaned up some of our slightly dirtier boom audio, as well as leveling
out the speech. Final render time out of Premiere came right after that.</p>

<p>A last minute call to the hotline for the festival confirmed that we could
present HD 24 fps footage, rather than being limited to 30 fps footage (as
the website had indicated). A quick burn of a DVD and dropping footage on
a flash drive which felt <em>far</em> too large for the content we were putting on
it, and we were off to the races – so to speak.</p>

<p>We hauled the 45+ minute drive through Providence to the drop off point, and
were the first team in our group (the “B” group) to hand in our materials
40 minutes before the 7:30 p.m. drop-off deadline. Yahtzee!</p>

<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Have an on-site audio engineer to take care of ADR duties.</strong> It’s a
serious pain to have to color <em>and</em> handle re-recording.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Get the cleanest boom audio possible.</strong> Make sure your boom operator is
getting pristine audio, as close as possible to the source, and monitoring
the levels.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Make sure your audio is being catalogued on set.</strong> It was a serious time
waster to do this late at night, and put off coloring work until the next
day.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Make sure someone is arranging rides.</strong> If someone needs to shuttle crew
around, make sure it’s not one of your department heads.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Screen your graded footage a few times before finalizing.</strong> I’m really
guilty of this one, as I noticed a few places where I needed to brighten
the midtones a bit, or match the color of the grass in some exterior shots
a bit better.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Make sure to let everyone know how important they are.</strong> In a 48 hour
film festival, there are no “unimportant” people. Everyone is doing their
job, and without them, things wouldn’t come together properly. Our 1st AD
(who is, by trade, a stage manager) had never worked on a film set before
– but you’d never know it, since she brought her “A” game with her.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="special-thanks">Special Thanks</h2>

<p>I’d like to thank:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5720821/">Natasha Darius</a></strong> – My
wife, co-writer, and general driving force behind everything I do. We
wouldn’t have done the 48 if it wasn’t for her talented writing and
creative spark, her tenacity in keeping everyone moving in the right
direction, and her infectious optimism. She was costuming and doing
actor prep for “Frankenstein” during this weekend, which made
everything else she was able to do (including prop shopping,
organization, writing, et cetera) that much more impressive.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3895408/">Nick Magrey</a></strong> –
Although he overbooks <em>everything</em> and wears far too
many hats, nothing would get done without him. Co-writing, acting,
production designing, wardrobe supervising… the list goes on and
on. Not to mention that he did this during the closing weekend of
his leading role in “Frankenstein” at the Bradley Playhouse.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4840208/">Curtis Reid</a></strong> – I give
him a lot of crap about everything, but he’s the other half of the
organizational aspect of all of this, as well as running <strong>Shoot the
Moon Films</strong>. I like to tell people “you need to get a Curtis” when
they ask how I manage to get stuff done. I shouldn’t downplay his
acting, either – I just usually focus on all of his producing duties.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6562104/">Jon Demers</a></strong> – He kept me
awake, gopher’d the crap out of everything, drove me everywhere, 
<strong>and</strong> found time to act. Give that man a gold star.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6854892/">Hannah Viens</a></strong> – 1st AD 
extraordinaire. She made sure that we were getting everything done,
and that’s no small task.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6562109/">Chelle Wright</a></strong> – Even
though she’s been doing MUA duties with us for a while, this was her
acting debut. Thank you for not only putting in a great performance,
but also for making everyone look so good!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The Entire Verrill Clan</strong> – 
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5220888/">Elizabeth</a> was acting and doing
sound work, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6854893/">Patricia</a> was taking
still photos, and they were nice enough to lend their lovely home and
property to us to trash judiciously for filming.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4941340/">Maureen Vlaco</a></strong> – You have
one of the longest commutes to set, but you were cheery, helpful, and
even drove <em>back</em> for audio re-recording right before a funeral. You
brought that character to life – thank you!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6854891/">Keith Murphy</a></strong> – I’ve never
worked with a stunt/fight guy before, but he was fantastic, in addition
to lending a double-popped-collar performance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6562110/">Paul Magrey</a></strong> – Booming, as
well as helping with all sorts of other stuff on set. Awesome job!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6562108/">Brandi Demers</a></strong> – You’re my
right hand on set, and threw in a performance to boot, not to mention
the time you put in prepping props!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Our post-production crew</strong> – 
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6854894/">Aaron</a> and
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6476893/">Garett</a>, especially. You guys
added so much production value with the precious little time we gave
you to work, and your work <em>completely</em> speaks for itself.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Okay; so you’ve got a DSLR, a RED, a Blackmagic Cinema Camera, a GoPro – what’s
next? The internet is littered with all sorts of tutorials aimed at trying to
reproduce the “Hollywood look”, but where to begin?</p>

<p>Over my time as a cinematographer, I’ve learned quite a bit about putting
together things that don’t look terrible. Unfortunately, I’ve learned most of
these through the painful process of trial and error. If there’s an item listed
in this article, I most likely ended up screwing up in that particular way at
one time or another.</p>

<p><em>A slight disclaimer: I’m a bit of a purist. I tend not to deal with
post-production effects except when absolutely necessary. I also <strong>hate</strong>
camera shake, especially intentionally induced camera shake.</em></p>

<p>With that out of the way…</p>

<h2 id="audiophilia-dont-skimp-on-sound">1) Audiophilia: don’t skimp on sound.</h2>

<p>If your sound is terrible, your work is going to be perceived as terrible. It
doesn’t matter how artistic your shots are, how talented your actors, or how
legendary your vision. Audiences (and critics) can forgive almost anything, but
they cannot forgive terrible sound.</p>

<p>Sound makes up half of your deliverable work, so logically you should be
spending half your time working on it, but most of the indie productions I’ve
seen tend to ignore it as much as possible. Don’t skimp on a sound engineer;
if you manage to find a really good one, do <strong>not</strong> let them go.</p>

<p>Don’t let just anyone operate your boom mic. Make sure they are actually
interested in doing it. They should preferably be listening to every take and
making sure that you have good, usable audio.</p>

<p>If you really need to, get an ADR and Foley engineer. Or learn how to do it
yourself – just make sure that you give sound a reasonable amount of
attention.</p>

<h2 id="spastic-squirrel-syndrome-dont-cut-movies-like-youve-never-seen-a-movie">2) Spastic squirrel syndrome: don’t cut movies like you’ve never seen a movie.</h2>

<p>Editing is the “directorial discretion of last resort”. You can make all sorts
of changes in editing, including changing the entire mood of your film.</p>

<p>Don’t cut it like you’ve never seen a movie before. I need to reiterate that.
<strong>Don’t cut it like you’ve never seen a movie before.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Consider continuity</strong>. If one of your characters has a bag of chips in his hand
one moment and doesn’t the next, it’s possible that your discontinuous method
of cutting is making a statement about the transient nature of existence or the
fragile mental state of your protagonist – but it’s far more likely that the
person in charge of continuity fell asleep at the switch.</p>

<p><strong>Don’t cut movies like music videos</strong>. A new trend has emerged where music
video directors are being promoted to full length feature direction.
Unfortunately, their attention-deficit style of cutting has become the norm
for every type of film, even non-action ones. If you can’t keep your
audience’s attention unless you cut every 1.5 seconds, you might need to
work on your script or actors.</p>

<p><strong>Respect the 180 degree and 15 degree rules</strong>. If you don’t know what they
are, read a few articles on the basic rules of editing.</p>

<p><strong>Respect the pacing</strong> … or at least <em>consider</em> the pacing. I’ve changed
pacing in editing, but the resulting pace has to be considered before you
finalize an edit.</p>

<p><strong>Too many cooks spoil the soup</strong>. Or in this case, the film. Have one, maybe
two people at most editing your film. Everyone is going to have a different
idea of where it should go or how it should be cut together – do <strong>NOT</strong>
allow a crowd of people to make editing decisions. Especially if they aren’t
editors. (Actors can be the worst, as they tend to be concerned with how they
look on film, rather than the overall aesthetic.)</p>

<h2 id="read-the-script-make-sure-you-really-want-to-make-this-script">3) Read the script. Make sure you really want to make this script.</h2>

<p>Not every script should be made into a film. Some scripts barely have enough
content or action to cover a 10 minute short, let alone a 120 minute feature
film. Some scripts are just horribly written.</p>

<p>Think of the standard distribution curve; going by that, most scripts are
mediocre, some are terrible, some are good. You’re going to need to reject the
majority of material with which you are presented if you’re only going to make
the best scripts into films.</p>

<p>Find an uninterested party (not your close friends, family, or actors who would
be potentially involved in the production of it) and describe the plot. If it
doesn’t interest them, there’s a very good chance that you may not have a wider
audience appeal than your group of friends and family.</p>

<p>I should point out, at this part of this article, that not everyone makes films
for mass audience appeal. If you don’t, don’t worry about it. Find someone who
specializes in the niche you’re targeting, and ask them for their opinion. It
could save you quite a few weeks/months/years on a real turkey of a project.</p>

<h2 id="good-actors-are-not-easy-to-come-by-make-sure-you-find-them">4) Good actors are not easy to come by. Make sure you find them.</h2>

<p>Actors’ skill levels also follow the standard distribution curve. Be picky about
working with them, if at all possible.</p>

<p>Actors have the very unique ability to completely ruin a scene if even one of
them is out of character or “off their game”. Even non-speaking background roles
can break the illusion that is your film, so try to be selective in choosing
actors. Unless you need a character with a flat affect, don’t use an actor who
can’t produce anything other than that affect.</p>

<p>Make sure your actors get a chance to run their lines together and “block”
scenes before the day when their scenes are shot. Most actors tend to produce
better group dynamics when they’ve had a chance to prepare their material
(which is one of the reasons why the \ater actors prepare so far in advance and
practice together).</p>

<p>Speaking of theater actors – they’re a great source for acting talent. Most
communities have community theaters, and they are usually stocked with a wide
variety of talented characters actors. There are some differences between film
and theater work, but their “acting chops” are worth the extra work that needs
to be put in.</p>

<h2 id="do-not-rely-on-inserts-for-the-bulk-of-your-movie">5) Do not rely on inserts for the bulk of your movie.</h2>

<p>There’s nothing wrong with insert shots; they tend to add a bit of spice and
variety, as well as giving your editor something to cut away to if there’s some
continuity issue between takes.</p>

<p>Do <strong>not</strong> rely on them for a majority of your film. They tend not to tell much
of a story, and overuse not only gives a feeling of claustrophobia, but is one
of the telltale signs of low-budget indie films.</p>

<p>Like many other suggestions I’ve made here, this isn’t an ironclad rule. There
are many art films which make extensive use of insert shots to tell a story in
a particular way.</p>

<h2 id="there-is-a-setting-on-your-lenses-other-than-wide-open">6) There is a setting on your lenses other than “wide open”.</h2>

<p>Ever since “bokeh” made its first appearance in the photographer/cinematographer
lexicon, there has been a proliferation of extensively thin DOF shots. These can
be used to great artistic effect, and can produce beautiful images – but, much
like other tools in a cinematographer’s toolbox, it shouldn’t be the only tool
you use. All of your characters should generally be in focus when they’re having
a conversation in most circumstances. Constantly focus-pulling between two
characters because you have a tissue-thin DOF tends to give off the impression
that you have no lighting budget, or that you don’t know how to use your lenses.</p>

<p>On top of all of that, most lower-cost lenses tend to not be as sharp as higher
grade lenses when they’re used wide-open. If you’re a fan of cheap Rokinon /
Samyang glass, it performs quite well – but not necessarily across the entire
frame wide open. Stopped down to f/4, it compares favorably with high-end Zeiss
and Canon glass, so if you can stop it down a bit further, you’ll get a better
quality image.</p>

<h2 id="time-theres-never-enough-of-it-corollary-the-enemy-of-the-good-is-the-perfect">7) Time: There’s never enough of it. Corollary: The enemy of the good is the perfect.</h2>

<p>There seems to be an inverse relationship between location availability and the
time consuming nature of the shots in a scene. I have tended to find that when
I spend more time setting up a shot, I will get better results than when I
“run and gun” the shots in a scene. (Like every other concept, this has
exceptions.)</p>

<p>Try to make sure you’ve metered and scouted your location properly before
placing actors in front of the camera. You’ll avoid a lot of time-wasting
adjustment and blown takes, which will translated into better looking shots and
a better end product.</p>

<p>As far as “the enemy of the good is the perfect”: it is rarely going to be
perfect. Deciding how much time to spend on that one insert may be the thing
which keeps you from rushing through the rest of your limited time at a
location. This is as much about time management as anything.</p>

<h2 id="prepare">8) Prepare.</h2>

<p>I’ve joked that my pre-production time on a film is longer than the actual
filming time. For the most part, this is actually the case.</p>

<p>Walking onto a set with no idea of what you’re going to do or how you’re going
to do it will lead to amateur errors, rushing, and a poor end product.
Preparation, be it storyboarding, notes, location scouting, or anything else,
is going to save you from some of the easy pitfalls which produce a cheap
end product.</p>

<h2 id="listen">9) Listen.</h2>

<p>You’re one person in (presumably) a fair sized crew of people. If you’re
directing something, you’re the decision maker. You’re the one who has to decide
how something is to be done and who is going to do it, or at least delegate that
to someone else.</p>

<p>If you’re a cinematographer/DP, you’re responsible for the visual aspect of the
film. You have to make the decisions as to how the cameras are set, or at least
delegate that authority.</p>

<p>That doesn’t mean that you can’t listen to other people. Some of my favorite
shots have come from suggestions I’ve gotten from other people. The ability to
look past your own hubris and take suggestions under consideration from other
people can open up your ability to shoot or direct better – and that shines
through in the final product.</p>

<h2 id="do-not-assume-you-can-fix-it-in-post">10) Do not assume you can “fix it in post”.</h2>

<p>“Fix it in post” has been a joke amongst my crew, since I’m not a big fan of
the filmmaking ethos centered around correcting everything in editing and
post production.</p>

<p>(I’m shooting with a rig which requires a fair amount of post production to
bring the footage to its final form, and to be clear, I don’t dislike or
hate post production. I dislike the idea of relying on it for things which you
could have done on set.)</p>

<p>Blood effects are a great example. Any monkey with a licensed (or unlicensed)
copy of After Effects can make a blood spatter effect, but it’ll look like a
low budget horror movie. If you’re going to do blood, do it with practical
effects. Squibs aren’t difficult to design, even on virtually no budget. People
have made them with such inventive materials as
<a href="http://www.refocusedmedia.com/how-to-make-diy-squibs/">condoms and fishing line</a>.
Just because we’ve entered an age of digital cinematography doesn’t mean we have
to throw out practical effects.</p>

<h2 id="one-more-for-safety">11) “One more for safety.”</h2>

<p>My cast and crew have been so used to me saying this phrase that they gave me
an etched mug with it on the side. No matter how well you think you’ve gotten a
scene on film, there’s always a chance that you’re missing something. There is
no worse feeling in editing than when you realize that you’re missing something
in one of your takes and have <strong>no fall back</strong>.</p>

<p>Take the extra few minutes and get another take of that “perfect take”. You’d
be surprised at how often you can avoid embarrassing cuts and amateur looking
transitions.</p>

<h2 id="context-understand-when-youre-doing-something-just-for-the-sake-of-doing-it">12) Context: understand when you’re doing something just for the sake of doing it.</h2>

<p>“Quadracopter” is a latin word which means “I need to wow my financial
backers”. Well, not really, but it could be, judging from the way they’re used.</p>

<p>Just because you have a certain rig or piece of equipment does not mean that
you should necessarily use it for everything you do. If you’re adding a shot
specifically to impress people instead of telling a story, your film is going
to suffer.</p>

<p>Sometimes you need a crane shot. Sometimes you need an overhead shot. Sometimes
you need a snorricam shot. There are plenty of things you <strong>can</strong> do, but your
job as a filmmaker is to be able to determine <strong>when</strong> you should.</p>

<p>Film is about emotional connection and content. If you have a hollow work with
a lot of style, you’ll impress a certain crowd, but it’ll be devoid of any sort
of deeper meaning. Stick with your artistic integrity for as long as you can –
you can always make money, but once you’ve sold out your integrity, you don’t
get it back.</p>

<h2 id="equipment-hubris-never-assume-your-equipment-will-save-you-or-make-you-better">13) Equipment hubris: never assume your equipment will save you or make you better.</h2>

<p>The most important piece of equipment you have as a cinematographer is your
eyes; everything else is much, much less important. I’ve seen films shot on
RED EPIC bodies which look like a high-schooler shot them, and films shot on
DSLRs which rival anything out of Hollywood.</p>

<p>Never assume that a new equipment purchase will make you a better
cinematographer. The only thing that will do that is <strong>time</strong>.</p>

<p>“Equipment hubris”, as I call it, leads to bad and amateur shots. If you just
received a new rig, make sure to log some hours using it before you bring it
on set. Screwing up a basic setting on a camera is a very easy way to destroy
an entire day’s worth of filming … or more.</p>

<h2 id="the-low-light-disease-or-why-i-learned-to-light-and-stopped-hating-my-work">14) The low-light disease, or why I learned to light and stopped hating my work.</h2>

<p>With the rise of the Sony A7 series, with ISO sensitivities of 100k+, and other
low-light and no-light cameras, we’ve also seen the rise of the no-lighting
production.</p>

<p>Hollywood lights the hell out of their films. Despite certain films trying to
portray a low-budget look, you can bet that they have a tractor-trailer full of
lights and lighting modifiers making each shot look good.</p>

<p>Stop assuming that you need speed boosters, faster lenses, and tricks to shoot
with less light. In all but a few cases, you need to add more light, not make
your camera accept more light – and that’ll take away the “cheap” quality
which comes from not using enough light. ETTR is the way to go – as long as
you don’t blow your highlights, you can always decrease the amount of light in
coloring/post-production, if you’ve taken that into account ahead of time.</p>

<h2 id="coloring--color-grading">15) Coloring / color grading.</h2>

<p>Coloring / color grading used to be referred to as “color correction”, but now
that so much more is done with it, “coloring” or “color grading” works as well
as anything else.</p>

<p>Hollywood films go through a round of color grading with people who spend their
professional lives doing it. You can’t just “apply a LUT” or “apply a curve” to
something and have it magically look like a million dollars, any more than an
Instagram filter can make a picture look better instead of just making it look
like it was taken with a terrible camera from the 1970s.</p>

<p>Color grading / coloring is a time-consuming, iterative process. It’s awful to
do, but it’s a necessary evil. It allows you to correct lighting problems
(assuming that your base footage has enough latitude to withstand the
corrections, of course), change color temperature, punch certain colors, and
even correct moving objects or flaws in the camera. It also allows a final
look and feel to be given to your project, which can help take away that indie
low-budget feel to your film.</p>

<p>Color grading / coloring won’t <em>save</em> a terrible film, but it can take a good
film and give it a look and feel which will keep it from being dismissed as
looking amateur.</p>

<h2 id="framing-stop-cutting-off-peoples-heads">16) Framing: stop cutting off peoples’ heads.</h2>

<p>One of the things that immediately jumps out at me about low-budget film
projects, and cheap cinematography in general, is framing. If you’re not paying
attention to the framing of your subject material, the edge of the frame becomes
a knife which slices at your subjects and surroundings.</p>

<p>If you’re going to use a special aspect ratio / crop bars, make sure that you’re
framing according to those bars. I had a project on which I had DP’d where the
decision to adjust aspect ratio was made <strong>after</strong> principal photography had
concluded. This left a bunch of shots where the actors looked decapitated.
These are all things to consider before you choose your focal length, camera
position, et cetera.</p>

<h2 id="dont-ask-for-money-unless-you-really-really-need-it">17) Don’t ask for money unless you really, really need it.</h2>

<p>This is more of a personal pet-peeve. Pay your crew if that’s your
arrangement. If you’re paying one actor, you pay them all. If you’re doing a
senior thesis project, or a festival piece, or something else which isn’t
slated for distribution, please do <strong>NOT</strong> go on kickstarter, gofundme, or any
of the other funding/begging sites to ask for 10-50k$ of money. If you end up
with a chunk of bad publicity and unhappy financial backers, it’s going to
reflect poorly on your film.</p>

<p>(I’m aware that this isn’t a “look and feel” thing, but permit me my slight
digression from the topic at hand; I feel that it is important enough to
mention.)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For whatever reason, there seems to be a serious dearth of information
regarding lens modification on the C-mount Computar 12.5mm f/1.3 lens. I am
going to share my experience modifying this lens, in the hope that it will
prevent other people from having the same issues which I have encountered.</p>

<p>As a quick disclaimer, you really should not blame me if you break your lens,
or if it eats your children or animals. This either will or will not work for
you. You have been warned.</p>

<p>You will need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>File or dremel</li>
  <li>Very small screwdriver (flathead)</li>
  <li>C-mount to M4/3 adapter (I used the Fotoasy one)</li>
</ul>

<p>1) <strong>File down the edges of the back mount a little.</strong> I do not think that I
   can stress “a little” enough. If you file this down too much, you will run
   into the same issue I ran into, and will break the back metal piece of
   your lens. I used a triangular file and edged it down to a nice smooth
   surface.</p>

<p>2) <strong>Unscrew the three screws at the base.</strong> This will remove the metal
   back of the lens.</p>

<p>3) <strong>Loosen the center column of the lens.</strong> You will see a small lens
   assembly protruding from the back of the rest of the lens. Loosen it a
   few turns. This is a trial-and-error thing, so be patient.</p>

<p>4) <strong>Reattach the backing with the screws.</strong> The lens assembly should be
   protruding further from the back of the C-mount to M4/3 adapter, when
   attached.</p>

<p>5) <strong>Attempt infinity focus.</strong> Attach to the camera, attempt focus.</p>

<p>If infinity focus is not attainable by step 5, repeat steps 2-5 until it is.</p>

<p>If you end up breaking or cracking the rear C-mount, you can permanently attach the lens to your C-mount to M4/3 adapter using some solder or hot-glue.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I can’t claim credit for this one – my extremely talented and resourceful
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3895408/">production designer</a> got the idea to
use an inexpensive slate “prop” and modify it slightly to allow the use of
erasable whiteboard markers. These are usually a bit more than seven dollars,
and we didn’t have the time to wait for one to arrive in the mail for the
shoot in question.</p>

<p>There are only two pieces of “hardware” which are required to make this,
along with a few pieces of duct tape, a sharpie, a ruler, and whatever 
whiteboard markers and erasers you are planning to use on the finished
slate.</p>

<p>You will need to buy these two items from a <a href="http://www.fivebelow.com/">Five Below</a> discount shop:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Slate Prop - $5</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.fivebelow.com/8-5-x-11-neon-dry-erase-boards.html">8.5 x 11 Eraseable Whiteboard</a> - $2</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Apologies for not giving a product link for the slate prop – I had trouble finding it on the Five Below site. I assure you, it does exist…</em></p>

<h2 id="assembly-instructions">Assembly Instructions</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Break the frame of the whiteboard, and remove the cardboard backing and
the broken frame. You should now have a piece of unencumbered whiteboard.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Position the whiteboard over the slate prop’s useless slate writing. You
can’t write on the slate with chalk, so it is pretty useless as-is.
Center it as best you can, then use strips of duct or gaff tape to attach
the whiteboard surface to the clapper.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use the ruler as a straight-edge to draw sharpie lines to denote the
different markable areas on your slate. In the best penmanship you can
muster, label them with the sharpie.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>It is a pretty simple hack, but quite effective for giving your editor a bit
of A/V sync assistance.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There are quite a few guides, tutorials, videos, and other resources on how to
capture usable boom audio. Most of these have a few usable sections with a
bunch of fluff or useless information accompanying them. This is my attempt to
compile a “quick guide” to capturing usable boom audio, assuming you don’t have
a competent audio engineer in your employ (which I highly recommend). Audio is
half of your deliverable product, as a cinematographer, so you should make sure
that you capture the highest quality audio possible.</p>

<h2 id="proximity-reflections-and-the-inverse-square-law">Proximity, Reflections, and the Inverse Square Law</h2>

<p>Much like light, sound decreases exponentially as you move away from the source
of the sound. One of the first things which you will realize when starting to
capture audio is that it sounds increasingly awful as you move further away –
which can be attributed to two things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>As you move further away, relative volume decreases</strong>. The background
sounds (“noise floor”, for anyone trying to be technical), consisting of both
the present background noises and any noises introduced in the recording
process, increase when you increase the sensitivity of your recording
equipment. As the source sound becomes quieter, bringing sound up in post
production will also increase that noise. <em>(If anyone says “just record some
room tone”, ignore them; it won’t help you if your source recording is
terrible, since that’s only a solution if you can gate and isolate the
primary sounds in post.)</em> This is one of the compelling reasons why boom
operators are utilized; they allow a recording to be made from closer to
the source.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Reflections</strong>. Light bounces off of everything, as we are taught, and we
have to be careful to deal with those reflections, in terms of color,
brightness, et cetera. Sound does the same thing. It bounces off of surfaces,
but because sound travels slower than light, we <em>notice</em> when it takes a
few milliseconds longer for sound to arrive at our recording device. Even
more insidious, those reflections (which take on different properties and
sounds based on the materials on which they are reflecting) can sound
<em>louder</em> than the original sound – which will make your recording sound
terrible. The closer you are in proximity to the source, the softer the
reflections will be, in comparison to the original sound.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="polarpickup-patterns">Polar/Pickup Patterns</h2>

<p>Not all microphones, or even microphone <em>types</em> are created equal. They all have
different “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microphone#Microphone_polar_patterns">polar patterns</a>”
which describe the areas of sensitivity which the microphones use to pick up
sound. When attempting to capture dialog, for example, an omnidirectional
microphone would be a poor choice, as it picks up sound equally from all
directions, taking away the ability to create greater isolation for the primary
sound source. The most popular boom microphone type is the “shotgun” microphone,
which has a very directed polar pattern, allowing specific isolation of the
sound in question.</p>

<h2 id="levels-peaking-and-limiting">Levels, Peaking, and Limiting</h2>

<p>Getting the recording level <em>just right</em> is one of the more tricky parts of
recording external boom audio. If the audio is too high, “peaking” will occur.
Peaking is the phenomenon which can be heard when the top part of a sinusoidal
wave (which naturally recorded sounds have) becomes squared when the top of the
wave is clipped by hitting the top limit for recording signal. If the audio is
too low, the signal-to-noise ratio will be too low, and bringing the signal up
to a usable level will bring the sound floor up to an obscenely loud level –
making gating nearly impossible to perform.</p>

<p>To properly deal with this, you need to adjust the signal level so that the
loudest sound comes in under 0 dB, which is where most recorders “peak”. If
certain sounds surpass 0 dB, some audio recorders have the ability to apply a
“limiter” effect, which will push the sound level back down to a usable value
as it is recorded. It’s not a desired effect, but it can save you from
clipping.</p>

<p>As you’re adjusting audio levels, you’ll see a constantly fluctuating level of
audio when no primary sound source is active. This is the “sound floor”, and
should be as far away from the bulk of the primary sound levels as possible.</p>

<h2 id="portable-recording-devices">Portable Recording Devices</h2>

<p>I recommend avoiding the <a href="http://amzn.to/1jyOxm5">Tascam DR-40</a> unit unless
you’re <em>positive</em> that you are using a balanced microphone. It tends to have a
weird firmware issue which produces a
<a href="http://www.dvxuser.com/V6/showthread.php?268124-Tascam-Dr-40-Buzz-Clicking-noise">strange clicking sound</a>
(almost impossible to remove) every quarter of a second when presented with an
unbalanced microphone. If you’re worried about this, go for the
<a href="http://amzn.to/QAUvXD">Zoom H4n</a>. It’s a bit more expensive, but it seems to
handle less expensive microphones in a more able fashion, as well as having
signal limiting and a host of other interesting features.</p>

<h2 id="compression-and-formats">Compression and Formats</h2>

<p>Most digital recorder units will record, at a minimum MP3 and WAV formats. WAV
is an uncompressed audio format, which means that it takes up more storage space
than a compressed format, but retains all of the information captured (at the
resolution captured). MP3 is a compressed format, using a psycho-acoustic model,
which means that it drops pieces of information which it figures we aren’t going
to be able to hear. MP3 files take up a smaller amount of space compared to
the same resolution WAV files – but that comes at the cost of throwing some
of the information out. MP3 @ 192kbps or above tends to have enough information
for most uses.</p>

<h2 id="equipment">Equipment</h2>

<p>There’s no “correct” equipment which you need to purchase to be able to capture
boom audio properly. There are, however, a few piece of equipment you’re
probably going to need.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Extendable Boom Pole</strong>. It’s tempting to go with a converted painters’
pole, but trust me – it pays to go with a decent boom pole. This is mainly
due to the additional noises which can be generated by swinging around a
makeshift boom pole. I personally recommend the
<a href="http://amzn.to/1l3TQaQ">On Stage MBP7000</a> boom pole for budget operators. It
doesn’t have an internal mic cable, but it works very well.</li>
  <li><strong>Microphone Cable (XLR)</strong>. This is an easy place to skimp for some people,
but you don’t want to pick up outside noise, so make sure you go with a
shielded XLR cable which is a few feet longer than the maximum size of your
boom pole, fully extended.</li>
  <li><strong>Clip / Shockmount / Zeppelin / Windscreen</strong>. You need something to isolate
the microphone from the wind, vibration, and other distorting effects of
the environment, which would distract from otherwise relatively clean
audio. Shockmounts can be had for relatively little, as can windscreens.
A zeppelin can cost a bundle, unless you make a DIY one – but they produce
very clean-sounding results.</li>
  <li><strong>Wire clips / wraps</strong>. Either some electrical tape (a cinematographer’s
best friend, after gaffe tape), or some inexpensive bobble hair ties
(available at most dollar stores) will allow you to keep the XLR cable
near the pole – otherwise you may find it dropping into frame at the most
inopportune times.</li>
  <li><strong>Microphone</strong>. There is a great deal of conjecture over the “best” budget
microphone to use. The most important things to consider are the polar
pickup pattern, the signal-to-noise ratio, and the frequency response of
any microphone you’re testing.</li>
  <li><strong>Portable digital recorder</strong>. Covered in the portable recorder section.</li>
  <li><strong>Headphones</strong>. A set of headphones, preferably full cup earphones, are
essential to monitoring the sound for disturbances and/or interruptions.
My favorite pair is the <a href="http://amzn.to/1qwuDgi">Sennheiser HD-280 PRO</a>,
as they’re relatively inexpensive (under 100 USD), and produce a fairly
accurate reproduction of live audio.</li>
  <li><strong>Storage media</strong>. Make sure you don’t buy off-brand media cards. Try to
stick with SanDisk and Lexar media, if you can. The trick is that these
companies generally tend to QA their products a bit more rigorously than
most off-brand manufacturers. This can make the difference between
usable audio and a very upset director.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="technique-and-directionality">Technique and Directionality</h2>

<p>Rather than iterate all of the techniques involved in actually operating a
boom mic rig, and keeping in mind that pictures are worth a thousand words…</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.viddler.com/player/39021abf/0/">Boom Mic 101</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Audio is half of your deliverables – so make sure your boom operator knows how
to deliver the best possible audio to your audio engineer for post production.
Good luck!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There are a number of “accepted” workflows for going between Adobe Premiere
(as an NLE) and Davinci Resolve (for color correction/grading) for BMPC4K
footage. I am going to detail the workflow I have been using, which should
be useful both for the BMPC4K camera, as well as the BMPCC and BMCC cameras.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Preparation</strong>. Make sure your camera is producing footage at the 23.98
fps frame rate, rather than 24 fps. “True” 24 fps is not quite the same
thing as the “24P” frame rate we are used to.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Load your media onto your workstation</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Create simple proxies</strong>. Using
<a href="https://github.com/shootthemoonfilms/prores-proxies">prores-proxies</a>,
create “cheap” lower quality proxies encoded using the H.264 codec in
Quicktime files. I have been experimenting with using the “.mpg”
extension to <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/VideoRoad/2012/12/premiere-pro-and-quicktime-and-nikon-oh-my.html">force Premiere to use its own internal Quicktime decoder</a>,
rather than the relatively dodgy external one, but the basic process
is the same.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Edit</strong>. Using the proxy files, edit your footage in Premiere. You do
not have to bother with any fancy transitions or effects yet – just
perform a basic edit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Export to Resolve</strong>. Export a “Final Cut Pro XML” file, using the
File &gt; Export menu option.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Create a new Resolve Project</strong>. Open Resolve, and create a new project.
Import the original files (not the proxies) into your media pool.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Import the XML from Premiere</strong>. Import the “Final Cut Pro XML” export,
with “Automatically import source clips into pool” deselected. This last
part is very important, as it forces Resolve to use the clips you already
have in the Media Pool.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Color Grade</strong>. Perform your color grade in Resolve.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Export</strong>. In the “Delivery” tab, select the whole timeline, choose
“Easy Setup”,and select  “Final Cut Pro XML Round-Trip”. Change any options
here to your liking.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Import Roundtrip XML in Premiere</strong>. Import the Round-Trip XML file in
Premiere. This will bring in all of the graded footage.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Perform the remainder of your edits</strong>. Tweak your footage, copy or
create your title cards, etc.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><em>This is a very basic overview of my current BMPC4K + Resolve + Premiere
workflow right now, and it may change.</em></p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>This year, my team (<a href="http://www.shootthemoonfilms.com">Shoot the Moon Films</a>),
entered the 2014 <a href="http://48hourfilm.com/en/boston/">Boston 48 Hour Film Festival</a>
for the first time. It’s an interesting experience, going from genre and
parameters to fully formed script, to planning and preproduction, to
shooting and execution, to editing, scoring, grading, and full post-production
in a single weekend. I’ve learned a lot about working with the 
<a href="http://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/blackmagicproductioncamera4k">BMPC4K</a>
camera in that time. I am going to iterate over some of the more important
things that I learned over the weekend.</p>

<h2 id="overheating">Overheating</h2>

<p>This simply did not happen. I had heard some horror stories about the camera
body breaking or overheating after long periods of filming, but even in 
direct sunlight for significant periods of time, I did not find this to be
the case. My EOS body used to overheat more than this one…</p>

<h2 id="nd-filters">ND filters</h2>

<p>My Tiffen 77VND was indispensible. If I didn’t have that single piece of
equipment, every exterior shot would have been very, very different. I wanted
a medium DOF and a standard shutter rate for my exterior shots – which meant
that the sunlight had to be stopped down. The variable ND filter delivered
perfectly.</p>

<h2 id="evf">EVF</h2>

<p>The Cineroid was a life-saver. I do not think I would have done as well
without its superior focus-peaking, crop indications, etc. The only feature
sorely missing from the EVF4CSS is waveforms/scopes, which would have been
a bit more useful than eyeballing the full extent of the dynamic range.</p>

<h2 id="v-mount-batteries">V-mount batteries</h2>

<p>If you are not turning your camera off between takes, you are going to need
more than one battery for a day-long shoot. Do <strong>NOT</strong> skimp on a V-mount
battery charger. They take a very long time to trickle charge, so make sure
you have a rapid charger. Also, spares. They may be expensive, but having to
wait on a battery charging could blow a shoot.</p>

<h2 id="audio">Audio</h2>

<p>This is less a “thing” with the BMPC4K body, and more of a general observation.
You cannot skimp on sound. You just <em>can’t</em>. You can always rely entirely on
tight OTS shots and other closeups and use on-camera mics, but it shuts off
an entire avenue of creative wider shots. A boom operator is <em>not</em> just your
buddy holding a mic on a pole – they need to know what they are doing,
otherwise you could be pushing very substandard audio into post-production.
Especially on a tight time limit, this can make the difference between making
a deadline, or having truly horrendous sound.</p>

<p>Also, get a really competent audio engineer. Preferably a really anal-retentive
one with an insane attention to detail. Even if you have perfect video, really
crappy audio can break the illusion of your film. <strong>DO NOT SKIMP</strong>. SERIOUSLY.</p>

<h2 id="that-pa-or-ad----you-need-them-more-than-you-think">That PA or AD – you need them more than you think</h2>

<p>If someone is not taking copious shot notes, you are going to find yourself
up at some ungodly hour, digging through footage for that shot that you
<em>know</em> you got. Save yourself the trouble, and have someone taking care of
all of that.</p>

<h2 id="proxy-files">Proxy files</h2>

<p>I used a new method of creating intermediate proxy files for editing, since
Premiere was not very cooperative in directly loading the Prores files from
the camera. <em>I made my code public in a project called
<a href="https://github.com/shootthemoonfilms/prores-proxies">prores-proxies</a>.</em> This
little trick made sure that, instead of having to render all of my footage
out at the Davinci Resolve speed of 3-6 fps (on my non-Red-Rocket workstation),
I was able to render it to proxies at about full speed (which was about 24fps).
Without this, I wouldn’t have been able to edit the footage without several
footage drops during the day – if at all – during the limited timeframe I
had to do so.</p>

<h2 id="premiere-quicktime-support-on-windows-is-dog-food">Premiere Quicktime support on Windows is dog food</h2>

<p>Something is wrong with it. I have no idea why, but the QT decoder decided
to “give up the ghost” quite a few times during editing. There is supposedly
a renaming hack, which allows the Premiere internal decoder to handle the
files, but I was not privvy to this information during editing. I will update
my documentation and/or author a post on this at some point in the near future,
as it is <strong>VERY</strong> irritating.</p>

<h2 id="too-many-cooks">Too many cooks</h2>

<p>One person edits. Someone can <em>assist</em> them, but you need to have one editor, 
who makes the decisions as to what goes into your final product. If you try
to “edit by committee”, you may end up with a very tired and frustrated primary
editor, and the possibility of some very incomprehensible footage.</p>

<p>If your editor and director are not the same person, the director sits in
with the editor to make decisions, where they need to be made. Ideally the
script notes, etc, provide enough information to the editor to perform his
job.</p>

<p>Also, do not get caught up in reviewing dailies if you are taking part in a
time-sensitive competition. This is a recipe for disaster.</p>

<h2 id="coloring">Coloring</h2>

<p>Even shooting with 10-bit ProRes 422 HQ, the advantage over H.264 DSLR
footage is immediately apparent. There is a lot of latitude for coloring
and correction, which would simply not be possible with the same level of
output quality with H.264.</p>

<p>I ended up performing a manual grading (as in, no LUTs or presets) for the
project we did, and I am very satisfied with the end result.</p>

<h2 id="grain">Grain</h2>

<p>I love the “film grain” that the sensor on this camera produces. I am sure
that I have mentioned it in earlier posts, but it really does give that
organic film look to your output.</p>

<h2 id="do-not-use-services-like-google-drive-for-your-deliverables">Do not use services like Google Drive for your deliverables</h2>

<p>They tend to like to really hurt you in upstream speeds – only when you are
on serious deadline. A better alternative for large media files is to set up
<a href="http://www.bittorrent.com/sync">btsync</a> on both sides, and transfer with far
more efficiency. You will be glad that you did it.</p>

<h2 id="too-many-hats--sink-ships">Too many hats … sink ships?</h2>

<p>There is serious temptation to wear more than one hat. Hell, we all wear more
than one hat on most small sets. The issue comes when you end up wearing
three or four (director, cinematographer, editor, colorist), and realize that
you do not get to sleep until everything is “out the door”. Delegate. Find
people who are good at this stuff, and let them do it. You do not have to be
good at everything, just find people who are.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I had a good time – but I could have been less stressed out, if I had known
some of this in advance.</p>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>As part of setting up the <a href="http://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/blackmagicproductioncamera4k">Blackmagic Production Camera 4K</a>,
I have been trying to put together a solid, fairly low-cost set of
accessories for the camera body.</p>

<p>I became aware of a low-cost Chinese cage for the BMCC/BMPC4K
bodies manufactured by an outfit called
“<a href="http://www.came-tv.com/">Xiamen Came Photographic Equipment Co., Ltd.</a>”,
which are available sporting both top and bottom 15mm rail mounts, 
along with the normal mounting options and handles present with
most cage designs. The cage in question is available for
<a href="http://www.came-tv.com/came06-bmcc-cage-for-blackmagic-design-cinema-camera-15mm-rail-p-477.html">$198, shipping included, from the manufacturer</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/came-06.jpg" width="289" height="400" title="&#34;CAME-06 Cage&#34;" alt="&#34;CAME-06 Cage&#34;" /></p>

<p>My unit arrived today, via DHL, in a box which seemed almost
Ikea-esque in its packing. First thing to note, which is not
indicated either on the website or the packaging: “some assembly
required”. Secondly – no instructions. Thankfully, the entire
assembly procedure seemed pretty obvious with the provided
Allen wrenches. I noticed that there is a 5/8” mount on the
bottom of the unit (as well as a 1/4”-20 mount) for attaching to
the fluid head or quick-release plate of your choosing. This wasn’t
indicated on the website, but I had my suspicions, which were
thankfully confirmed.</p>

<p>The first major issue I encountered was the lack of four of the
required screws for assembly. Undaunted, I took a quick trip to 
the nearest “home improvement” store, and purchased four
M4-.70 x 12 bolts with phillips heads (in packs of two), which
worked like a charm.</p>

<p>The second slightly annoying issue was that one of the included
30cm 15mm rods was completely unthreaded, so it wouldn’t be
possible to attach it to any other rods, should it need to be
extended. The inclusion of the rods was a bit of a plus, so I
can’t really be too upset about that.</p>

<p>The build quality, once assembled, is quite good. The CAME-06
cage is machined properly, and does not interfere with the
operation of the BMPC4K unit at all, and has enough mount points
to allow me to put handles, arms, and other accessories on it,
which was the secondary purpose of purchasing the cage, after
being able to properly mount the camera on a decent QR plate.</p>

<p>Additionally, it has a set of Hirth joints on either side,
ostensibly for attaching handle mounts. I have no use for them
at the moment, but they seem to be workable.</p>

<p>As the next step up in price is another 70$, and this unit
arrived from China in less than four business days from my
initial order, the annoyance of a $1.00 bolt purchase seems
miniscule, considering the usability of the cage itself. It
isn’t a full system, like the Tilta, Lanparte, and others,
but can be built into a system incrementally.</p>

<p>Verdict: Know what you’re getting yourself into. If you want
a pre-assembled unit, next day shipping, and would rather pay
more money for the lack of inconvenience, you should avoid the
CAME-06. It’s a good deal for the price, however.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

<p><em>Postscript: The manufacturer offered to reimburse me for the
missing screws within a day of me writing to them, so they do
seem to be relatively responsive whenever there is a mixup.</em></p>
