    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As part of setting up the <a href="http://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/blackmagicproductioncamera4k">Blackmagic Production Camera 4K</a>,
I have been trying to put together a solid, fairly low-cost set of
accessories for the camera body.</p>

<p>I became aware of a low-cost Chinese cage for the BMCC/BMPC4K
bodies manufactured by an outfit called
“<a href="http://www.came-tv.com/">Xiamen Came Photographic Equipment Co., Ltd.</a>”,
which are available sporting both top and bottom 15mm rail mounts, 
along with the normal mounting options and handles present with
most cage designs. The cage in question is available for
<a href="http://www.came-tv.com/came06-bmcc-cage-for-blackmagic-design-cinema-camera-15mm-rail-p-477.html">$198, shipping included, from the manufacturer</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://jbuchbinder.com/images/came-06.jpg" width="289" height="400" title="&#34;CAME-06 Cage&#34;" alt="&#34;CAME-06 Cage&#34;" /></p>

<p>My unit arrived today, via DHL, in a box which seemed almost
Ikea-esque in its packing. First thing to note, which is not
indicated either on the website or the packaging: “some assembly
required”. Secondly – no instructions. Thankfully, the entire
assembly procedure seemed pretty obvious with the provided
Allen wrenches. I noticed that there is a 5/8” mount on the
bottom of the unit (as well as a 1/4”-20 mount) for attaching to
the fluid head or quick-release plate of your choosing. This wasn’t
indicated on the website, but I had my suspicions, which were
thankfully confirmed.</p>

<p>The first major issue I encountered was the lack of four of the
required screws for assembly. Undaunted, I took a quick trip to 
the nearest “home improvement” store, and purchased four
M4-.70 x 12 bolts with phillips heads (in packs of two), which
worked like a charm.</p>

<p>The second slightly annoying issue was that one of the included
30cm 15mm rods was completely unthreaded, so it wouldn’t be
possible to attach it to any other rods, should it need to be
extended. The inclusion of the rods was a bit of a plus, so I
can’t really be too upset about that.</p>

<p>The build quality, once assembled, is quite good. The CAME-06
cage is machined properly, and does not interfere with the
operation of the BMPC4K unit at all, and has enough mount points
to allow me to put handles, arms, and other accessories on it,
which was the secondary purpose of purchasing the cage, after
being able to properly mount the camera on a decent QR plate.</p>

<p>Additionally, it has a set of Hirth joints on either side,
ostensibly for attaching handle mounts. I have no use for them
at the moment, but they seem to be workable.</p>

<p>As the next step up in price is another 70$, and this unit
arrived from China in less than four business days from my
initial order, the annoyance of a $1.00 bolt purchase seems
miniscule, considering the usability of the cage itself. It
isn’t a full system, like the Tilta, Lanparte, and others,
but can be built into a system incrementally.</p>

<p>Verdict: Know what you’re getting yourself into. If you want
a pre-assembled unit, next day shipping, and would rather pay
more money for the lack of inconvenience, you should avoid the
CAME-06. It’s a good deal for the price, however.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

<p><em>Postscript: The manufacturer offered to reimburse me for the
missing screws within a day of me writing to them, so they do
seem to be relatively responsive whenever there is a mixup.</em></p>

    <id>http://jbuchbinder.com/2014/03/16/first-look-at-the-blackmagic-production-camera-4k</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was lucky enough to be one of the early people on the waiting list for
<a href="http://www.blackmagicdesign.com/">Blackmagic Design</a>’s new 4K “Production
Camera” body, which I received last week. It boasts a global shutter, Ultra
4K resolution, ProRes/RAW recording at 1080p/4K resolutions, a super 35mm
sensor, EF mount, and around 12 stops of dynamic range – among other
features. I took it out for a test spin with a fellow cinematographer, just
to see how far I could push the image.</p>

<p>After a test run of “horror” shots with both a Canon EF IS lens and a
manual Rokinon Cine lens, I’ve been learning about the benefits and caveats
of the BMPC body. I’m going to enumerate some of those here.</p>

<h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2>

<p><strong>Dynamic Range</strong>. This cooks the hell out of the H.264 image that I’ve been
getting out of the 5D mark III. I can see a full gamut of sky color without losing my subjects – and that’s without additional or reflected light.</p>

<p><strong>Cinematic Quality</strong>. This might have something to do with the depth of the
image, or the amazing amount of data that the body is storing for each frame,
but it is definitely capable of breathtaking quality. I haven’t seen any
artifacts from the footage I’ve taken so far, at either HD or 4K resolution.</p>

<p><strong>Metadata</strong>. The touch screen allows some metadata to be stored for each
clip, including the name of the project, scene number, etc, and allows it to
be edited on the camera body afterwards. It also has a numeric unique numbering
system, with customizable body IDs, which beats the MVI_xxxx.MOV or
MM1Axxxx.MOV scheme from Canon.</p>

<p><strong>Resolve</strong>. The body comes with a <em>full</em> copy of DaVinci Resolve 10. The
only way to truly appreciate it is to actually use it. It essentially puts
Fast Color Corrector and Colorista to shame. The only downside is that it
does take quite a bit longer to run than most of the plugin-based correction
and grading tools, unless you’re willing to invest in either a Red Rocket
card or a bunch of fairly powerful GPU units for your machine. Either way,
it is well worth the time and effort to learn how to use it.</p>

<p><strong>Baked in Zebras and Focus Peaking</strong>. This is less of a revelation for me,
coming from using Magic Lantern, but users of stock Canon bodies don’t know
what they’re missing. You can also acquire these via EVF features – but it
can’t be a bad thing to have those features in the body, as well.</p>

<p><strong>Crop Factor</strong>. It’s about the same crop factor as an APS-C crop, for you
7D and Rebel users, so it’s only a big deal to acclimate if you’re coming
from a full-frame body, like the 5D or 6D. The upshot is that you’re not
going to have to blow a lot of money on extremely wide glass, as would be
required by the BMPCC.</p>

<p><strong>Global Shutter</strong>. If you have a lot of fast motion or quick pans, the lack
of the “jello” effect from rolling shutter is very, very noticeable. This is
one of the prime reasons I purchased this body – and it works as well as
promised.</p>

<p><strong>RAW and ProRes</strong>. (Yes, I know “RAW” isn’t an acronym – I just like it enough to shout it…) No firmware hacks, no playing around, you get ProRes
and RAW footage out of this camera body. As of the time of writing, RAW has
been disabled in the firmware, but I’m expecting an update “any day now”
which will re-enable it. This makes me think twice about having usde H.264
as a codec for so long. And the logarithmic data collection means that all
of that nice dynamic range is intact through the coloring process, so you’re
not losing out there.</p>

<p><strong>EF Mount</strong>. This is a big deal for me, as it keeps me from having to rebuy
all of my glass. All of my M42, EF, and Nikon mount glass will be fine with
this. And as an added bonus, the FD mount glass I have (using the Lens
Doctor EF-FD mount adapter) works fine, and without the vignette I have on
the full-frame sensor.</p>

<h2 id="caveats">Caveats</h2>

<p><strong>Mounting</strong>. The standard 1/4” mount on the bottom of the camera is more
or less useless; the mount plates either shift or scratch the bottom of the
camera – so I ended up using the aluminum handles for my tests. They’re not
particularly useful, considering the weighting of the camera, so I’m waiting
for a cage to arrive. I only considered cages with upper and lower 15mm
rod mounts (for options, of course). These are the ones I found to be the
best choices:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.came-tv.com/came06-bmcc-cage-for-blackmagic-design-cinema-camera-15mm-rail-p-477.html">CAME-06 BMCC Cage</a> - $198 -
The cheapest of the non-ePhoto bunch. It’s just a cage with two 30cm
15mm rods included, so you have to kit the rest of it out, but it’s
potentially the best deal, considering the price jump to the
Wooden Camera or Tilta rigs.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.ginirigs-usa.com/bmcc-rigs-and-cages/207-the-bmcc-box-cage.html">Gini Box Cage for BMPC</a> - $269 -
This is a slightly more well-known version of the CAME-06. I don’t know
the difference in build quality, but you’re getting similar type kitting.</li>
  <li><a href="http://amzn.to/NkeVCv">Wooden Camera Base Kit</a> - $939 -
A well designed, modular kit. Expensive, but potentially worth it.</li>
  <li><a href="http://amzn.to/1lGfAud">Tilta TT-BMC-05</a> - $1570 -
Not necessarily the most affordable, but very well designed. Expect to
pay a hefty markup for their branded accessories. Note that this is an
<em>entire</em> rig, rather than just a base kit, so the extra money is probably
worth it, if you have it.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Glossy Screen</strong>. The screen is <em>very</em> reflective. I completely understand
the virtual need for an EVF, otherwise you’re in daguerreotype shade cloth
territory. Because it has SDI outputs, rather than HDMI, it’s probably a
good idea to go with one of the SDI EVFs. Unfortunately, they’re not cheap.
You more or less have the pick of these:</p>

<ul>
  <li><del><a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/827800-REG/Cineroid_EVF4MSS_EVF_Metal_with_HD_SDI.html">Cineroid EVF4MSS</a> - $699 - 
The least expensive of the set.</del></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/982065-REG/cineroid_evf4css_electronic_viewfinder.html">Cineroid EVF4CSS</a> - $599 -
I realized that you can’t really use the EVF4MSS, despite its metal
materials, because it only supports up to 1080i, whereas the BMPC4k
requires 1080p.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/894123-REG/Cineroid_EVF4RVW_with_Retina_Display.html">Cineroid EVF4RVW</a> - $995 -
Retina display version of the EVF4CSS. Higher resolution, higher price.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/852192-REG/Alphatron_Broadcast_Electronics_EVF_035W_3G_EVF_035W_3G_Electronic_View_Finder.html">Alphatron EVF-035W-3G</a> - $1395 -
The most expensive, but also most highly reviewed SDI EVF. Shane Hurlbut,
A.S.C., endorsed this particular EVF for use with the BMPC body.</li>
</ul>

<p>Otherwise, you’re in the market for both an EVF and an HDMI-to-SDI converter,
which will tack on an addition few hundred dollars. The temporary budget
solution, in my case, is to use a cloth until the EVF arrives …</p>

<p><strong>Battery Life</strong>. The internal battery isn’t supposed to provide much shoot
time ; virtually everyone using the camera has pointed out that it’s meant
to be a sort of “buffer” between battery changes with an external battery.
I bought a <a href="http://amzn.to/1m9XDal">Switronix PB-70</a> for the body, which
sports a RED-style <a href="http://www.red.com/store/products/accessory-v-mount">V-mount</a>,
as well as a traditional 1/4”-20 mount. It can power the camera alone for
at least four hours, and can additionally power other devices, like EVFs,
HDMI-SDI converters, monitors, follow focus devices, et cetera, by the
extensible power connectors. I have to buy an extra one, so I can have one
charging and one plugged in, but it seems to be a decent solution.</p>

<p>Additionally, it helps to have the battery mounted on the camera assembly,
otherwise it is moderately unweildy. The cheapest mounting solution for
15mm rods I found was the <a href="http://amzn.to/1m9YGao">Ikan BMC-PBK-1-S</a> mount,
which has a small distribution center built into it. It’s slightly redundant,
as the adapter that came with the PB-70 isn’t used, but for the money, it’s
a good buy. It may make sense to buy the slightly more expensive
<a href="http://amzn.to/1hcVO4P">Lanparte plate</a>, which has a number of additional
power outputs.</p>

<p><strong>The Sun</strong>. Besides the glossy screen, the sun tends to blow out the fairly
sensitive BMPC4k sensor. The solution is to use ND filters to reduce the
amount of light coming into the sensor. You might be tempted to increase the
f-stop, but you’ll also be increasing the depth of field to be more
un-cinematic, so the ND filter is a must-have if you find yourself shooting in 
the direct sun, and don’t want to start using high shutter speeds. The
downside is going to come in the “price” category; if you buy cheap ND filters,
it will destroy the quality of the image, so you’re best off sticking with
Tiffen or other brand-name high quality filters. They don’t come particularly
cheap, however.</p>

<p>My recommendation to get started would be the 
<a href="http://amzn.to/1qINli9">Tiffen 77VND</a> 77mm variable neutral density
filter. It handles most of the reduction you’ll need, and at about $150, it’s
far less expensive than a set of 4x4 filter glass.</p>

<h2 id="overall">Overall</h2>

<p>I’m glad I didn’t wait for the Panasonic GH4. I know that’s going to come
off as a little odd, but for the smaller sensor, M4/3 mount and its relatively
insane crop factor, expensive add-on cinema kit, even <em>odder</em> form factor,
H.264 codec, limited dynamic range, and rolling shutter – I feel that the
BMPC4k body is going to do just fine. After all, no camera body makes you
film better, or makes you a better cinematographer. All it can do is allow
you the ability to increase your output quality – if you work for it.</p>

<p><em>NOTE: I haven’t posted any video clips yet due to the stabilization issues
I had encountered using the handles alone. I may update the post to include
some stills and short clips with the IS lens.</em></p>

    <link href="http://jbuchbinder.com/2013/12/21/lens-selection-for-cinematography/"/>
    <updated>2013-12-21T19:48:18-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://jbuchbinder.com/2013/12/21/lens-selection-for-cinematography</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The lens of your camera is arguably one of the most important parts of the
camera ; it has the job of controlling light, adjusting focus (and focal
length in variable focal length lenses), controlling depth-of-field
through the aperture, and adding character to the shots you have lovingly
framed. <em>(It should be noted that the sensor of a digital video camera
body is also very important, in terms of sensitivity, resolution, size,
and other factors, but it is out of the scope of this article.)</em></p>

<p>There are quite a few factors to consider when choosing the lens you will
use for a shot, as well as the lenses you will pack for a shoot. Do you
pack one or two variable focal-length lenses, or do you pack a series of
strategic length prime lenses? Do you stay with your native lens mount?
Do you use vintage lenses? Do you need super-fast lenses?</p>

<p>As of the writing of this, I’ve been known to primarily use three or four
prime lenses (24mm, 35mm, 50mm, and 85mm), while packing a 105mm or 135mm
with a set of extension tubes for extreme macro usage. This setup will
<strong>not</strong> work for everyone, as I will explain.</p>

<h2 id="lens-mount">Lens Mount</h2>

<p>There are several types of lens mounts, and depending on the type of camera
body you use, one (or two) will be a “native” mount. For example, if you
shoot using a Canon EOS camera (T3i, 7D, 5D mk3, C100, etc), you will most
likely be using primarily EF mount lenses (and/or EF-S lenses if you aren’t
shooting with a full-frame sensor). These native lenses have the advantage
of having auto-focus / focus-confirmation electronics, as well as being able
to mount with no additional hardware required. Auto-focus isn’t really an
issue with cinematography, and focus-confirmation isn’t a <em>huge</em> advantage,
especially if your camera has focus peaking – but these lenses were
<em>designed</em> to work with your camera body.</p>

<p>Other lens mounts can be accommodated with adapter rings, which can usually
be purchased for varying amounts from online retailers. I have a few
M42 adapter rings for using old Pentax screw-mount lenses with the EF mount
on my camera, and they work flawlessly for me. Some of the more expensive
ones even have focus confirmation capabilities.</p>

<p>Photographers might give some pause to the idea of not having focus
confirmation or auto focus, but cinematographers should be fine with it.
Lens mount should only factor into your decision to use a lens by whether
or not you have the appropriate adapter ring configuration to use that
lens, in my opinion.</p>

<h2 id="prime-or-variable-focal-length-zoom">Prime or Variable Focal Length (Zoom)</h2>

<p>A great deal of the answer to this question depends on the primary type
of cinematography in which you tend to engage. A variable focal length
lens is essentially a single lens which offers an “infinite number of
focal lengths between its two bounds”, but there are other factors to be
considered when using one. For example, many lower-cost variable focal
length lenses will tend to have variable maximum apertures, depending on
the target focal length.</p>

<p>If you’re engaged in documentary cinematography or non-planned shoots
(such as many modern “web series” shoots), you may want to stick with
the widest range of variable focal length lens you can accommodate. A
24-70mm lens will usually handle most shots which would be required by
those mediums, and will mostly eliminate the hassle of changing lenses
during critical (and possibly situationally-limited) shoot times.</p>

<p>A serious trade-off is that most variable focal length lenses are not
“fast” (i.e. do not have a very low f-stop number for their maximum
aperture size), and therefore tend to require more light. The faster
lenses among that class tend to increase in cost greatly.</p>

<p>Prime lenses usually do one thing, and try to do it very well. They
range down (and below) f/1.2, and are far more cost effective for a
single focal length. If you have the time to change lenses in between
shots, and tend away from smash zooms (which I tend to find are a bit
over-used) and dolly/zoom combination shots, you might want to tend
towards a collection of primes.</p>

<h2 id="how-fast-is-fast">How fast is fast?</h2>

<p>The majority of consumer-grade lenses tend to have smaller maximum aperture
sizes than f/2.8, but there are a fair number of inexpensive primes which
can be had with an f/2.8 maximum aperture size, and relatively inexpensive
(compared to some) lenses can be had down to f/1.4 or so, depending on the
relative concessions you’re willing to make regarding the lens quality,
mount, manufacturer, et cetera.</p>

<p>As the aperture size increases, the depth of field decreases in size, but
the amount of light hitting the sensor increases. Low light cinematography
has historically relied on “fast” lenses rather than increased sensor
sensitivity, primarily due to the increasing role that sensor “noise” 
plays at high ISO levels. This tradeoff means that you may have to decide
whether depth of field or light sensitivity will be the primary determining
factor in the maximum aperture rating of the lenses you’re using.</p>

<p><em>NOTE: Another thing to note is that lenses tend not to be their sharpest
or best when fully open, so you may have to shoot slightly further shut
than the maximum aperture rating.</em></p>

<h2 id="vintage-lenses">Vintage Lenses</h2>

<p>Some cinematographers (and photographers) will <em>swear</em> by vintage glass.
Optics from lenses like old Carl Zeiss lenses are still amazing, and some
of these lenses are sold for less than the comparable modern lenses for
them. It can be a potentially <em>expensive</em> habit, however, since
cinematographers have been driving up the cost of purchasing these lenses,
as their lack of focus controls is far less bothersome than it would be
to photographers.</p>

<p>If you can purchase vintage lenses (or happen upon a cache of them), it’s
something to seriously consider. They have their own character, and when
used thoughtfully, can add much to your footage.</p>

<h2 id="focal-length">Focal length</h2>

<p><em>NOTE: If you’re going with variable focal length lenses exclusively, 
you may be able to safely skip this section. It deals mostly with the
reasoning behind using certain focal length lenses.</em></p>

<p>Selection of focal length depends on a number of factors. Entire chapters,
and even whole <em>books</em> have been written about selecting focal lengths
for cinematography and photography. A great deal of it has to do with
the type of shot you are working with, as well as the framing, etc. I’m
going to hit some of the considerations, but I suggest further reading.</p>

<p>When considering focal lengths on cameras, I tend to consider them using
the standard of a “full frame” sensor, since my camera has one. This means
that the written focal length of a lens corresponds directly to the
<em>effective</em> focal length of that lens. A larger “crop factor” (which is
the case for smaller sensor sizes, like the Canon APS-C sensor and the
Micro 4/3 sensors) means that a lens’s effective focal length is longer
for those sensors. You can figure out the effective focal length by
multiplying the stated focal length by the crop factor. For example,
an APS-C crop factor is 1.5x, so a 35mm lens would have an effective
focal length of 52.5mm, and a 50mm lens would have an effective focal
length of 75mm.</p>

<p>“Wide angle” shots, which are usually used for establishing shots in
cinema, generally tend to rely on very “wide” lenses, which are lenses
with short focal lengths. As you move further away from 35mm effective
focal length, the field of view present in your frame increases, which
increases geometric distortion towards the edges of the frame. This has
been referred to as a “fish eye” effect, when present in more than
moderate amounts.</p>

<p>As an aside, I have seen cinematographers use extremely wide lenses
(18mm and shorter) to shoot closeup shots of actors and actresses in
tight quarters – and I must warn against it, unless you are 
<strong>acutely aware</strong> of the geometric distortion which you are introducing
into the frame. This has very unpleasant effects on the faces of actors
when used for close shots, and I know few actors who take kindly to being
represented in a grossly distorted manner.</p>

<p>A 50mm effective focal length is essentially what your eye sees; at least,
that’s the way I’ve come to think of it. It’s a very neutral lens to use
for most shots. I recommend that this length be a standard part of any
lens kit you’re putting together.</p>

<p>50mm lenses have been popular with the Canon DSLR cinematography crowd,
primarily due to the inexpensive nature of the “nifty fifty”, a 50mm
f/1.8 prime which clocks in at a little over 100 USD new. Its optics aren’t
that fantastic, but its point of entry is so low in the cost department
that many people will own one. If you do, consider buying an f/1.4 version
of the same lens (or the f/1.2 L, if you’re successful, or have some sort
of trust fund laying around), as the optical and build quality is far
superior to the 50mm f/1.8 lens. It’s a “midway” focal length, but very
usable for a variety of shots.</p>

<p>Greater than 50mm effective focal lengh lenses are considered “long”
lenses. They tend to “compress” the space they capture, much as wide angle
lenses tend to expand and distort it. One must be careful with using long
lenses for handheld and steadicam work, as camera shake tends to be
magnified with longer lenses. </p>

<p>Long lenses can also be used for closeup and extreme closeup shots by using
“extension tubes” – what my brother used to refer to as “expensive air”.
They increase the amount of light required, and are not as easy or compact
as most macro lenses, but they’re relatively cheap, and cut down on the
number of lenses you have to carry.</p>

<h2 id="what-the-hell-is-a-bokeh">What the hell is a “bokeh”?</h2>

<p>The term “bokeh” is a recent addition to the vocabulary of the photographer
and cinematographer ; it simply refers to the blur produced by out of
focus objects, particularly lights, by a lens. It is determined largely by
the quality of the optics of the lens, as well as the number of blades in
the lens’s aperture. Higher blade counts generally produce more “pleasing”
bokeh, approaching the cinematic standard of almost circular light blur.</p>

<h2 id="you-havent-told-me-which-lenses">You haven’t told me which lenses!</h2>

<p>This isn’t intended to dictate which lenses a cinematographer <em>must</em> carry,
nor push certain choices over others, but merely to attempt to educate
about sensible lens selection.</p>

<p>Consider buying a Pelican case, or other shock resistant case, for travelling
to shoots. If you’re carrying a lot of glass, you can’t afford to deal
with the downtime of a broken lens.</p>

<p>There are a huge number of lenses, both modern and “ancient”, and you can
equip yourself with any variety of lenses, depending on your particular
idiom and shooting style. Don’t fall into the trap of assuming that lens
selection is unnecessary, or that everything should be shot with a single
lens ; it’s just another aspect of cinematic creativity. Good luck!</p>

    <updated>2013-11-28T11:08:17-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://jbuchbinder.com/2013/11/28/dynamic-range</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As a photographer or cinematographer, I’m sure you’ve come into contact with
limitations in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_range">dynamic range</a>.
I have run into limitations with dynamic range in both the visual and audio
field, since anything that involves “real world” signals is going to 
potentially run up against the ability of the digital mediums on which we
rely to properly store the entire gamut of available analog data that we are
able to perceive with our eyes and ears. To combat the loss of data, computer
scientists and electrical engineers developed the process of dynamic range
compression, which is usually referred to as simple “compression”. This
reduces the gamut of presented information to a digitally representable
format. There is, however, something which is lost – and that is the
original dynamic range ; the amount of variance between the strongest and
weakest signal. In small doses, or when done with finesse, this provides the
ability to produce better sounding and better looking content in the digital
realm. When overused, we see results like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudness_war">loudness war</a>.</p>

<p>I like to explore the more figurative aspects of many technical concepts, to 
which most avid readers of my work would attest. In that vein of ideas, consider
the derivative concept of dynamics as a function of cinematic tension/resolution
and feeling.</p>

<p>Much like a written work, cinematic works generally tend to follow a
“<a href="http://www.dailywritingtips.com/how-to-structure-a-story-the-eight-point-arc/">plot/story arc</a>”,
which have a number of basic stages, even if the presentation, order, and
presence will vary between works. As cinematographers, one of our jobs is to
attempt to portray the basic plot elements, character interactions, and other
potentially metaphysical aspects of the story through the lensing, lighting,
focal points, composition, and method of stabilization and capture we use.
<em>(I’m aware that there are other control points, but forgive me my omissions
for the sake of some semblence of brevity.)</em> For example, for a more
“cinéma vérité” style for a combat or heavy action sequence, a filmmaker could
choose to shoot with less stabilization, looser composition, and less staged
lighting, which would present the audience with the perception that the scene
is far closer to the work of a documentarian than a staged film scene. In
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120815/">Saving Private Ryan</a>, for example, the
battle scenes have a decreased exposure time, resulting in action appearing
far more caustic and (what we believe is) more realistic. This allows the
relative dynamics of the scenes in question to be raised to allow far more
tension and action to be shown, through simple camera work.</p>

<p>The issue with techniques like this begin to manifest themselves when they
begin to flatten the dynamic of a film work through rampant and flagrant
overuse. At some point, cinematographers realized that they could shoot
<em>entire films</em> with these techniques, ostensibly to raise those tension and
action levels to that same high. By doing this, they have effectively
flattened the dynamic range of their works, producing an effectively and
uniformly “loud” work. The questions that you might be asking are “why is this
a bad thing, and why should I care?”</p>

<p>We view things as deltas, or differences. We understand happiness because we
understand sadness, heat because we experience cold, and comfort and
companionship because we can contrast it with loneliness. If the range we are
give to deal with is only the “best parts”, we begin to lose our ability to
appreciate it, and all of those things which should have made it special and
artistic become mere convention. Think about it – if everyone screamed
everything at the same volume, rather than having varying levels of emphasis
and volume, wouldn’t that screaming have lost its impact and importance?</p>

<p>Every technique that you have as a cinematographer or photographer is another
potential tool in your figurative tool box; but just because you have them
doesn’t mean that you have to use one particular one <em>all the time</em>. Handheld
camerawork has its place, and even though modern technology has provided many
methods of stabilizing camera and lens motion, from the steadicam to image
stabilization/vibration reduction lens to three point shoulder rigs, we still
find many cinematographers intentionally introducing shake into their
footage. I wrote an <a href="http://jbuchbinder.com/2013/06/03/stabilization/">entire essay</a> 
on the importance of stabilization, so I won’t reiterate my grievances here.</p>

<p>It’s important to understand why you’re doing something rather than
simply doing it for convenience or convention. If you’re using a wide open
aperture, are you doing it because you’re having lighting issues, or simply
because you think that everything should be shot with the thinnest DOF
possible? Is there some sort of artistic reason why you chose to shoot with
a 24mm vs a 35mm lens for a particular shot? Are you using a tripod-based
shot rather than a steadicam for a reason? Asking questions and analyzing
your own work, as well as the work of others, is key to artistic growth, as
well as understanding how to use your skillset as a photographer or
cinematographer.</p>

<p>I am, by no means, at the top of the skill grouping for photography <em>or</em>
cinematography. Many of the entries I have authored here are products of
making mistakes, and they are the attempt I am making to keep others from
having to make some of the very same mistakes I have made. Even films and
other work which we don’t particularly like as a whole may have a few 
setups or shots which provide food for thought. So, watch those films with
a critical eye, and hopefully we can all expand our “toolboxes”, as well
as learn how to use them in a more effective manner. Good luck!</p>

    <link href="http://jbuchbinder.com/2013/11/19/signal-to-noise-ratio/"/>
    <updated>2013-11-19T15:06:51-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://jbuchbinder.com/2013/11/19/signal-to-noise-ratio</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>To quote the venerable Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Signal-to-noise ratio (often abbreviated SNR or S/N) is a measure used in science and engineering that compares the level of a desired signal to the level of background noise.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This has a number of applications in engineering, but it also nicely
encapsulates a basic truth of dealing with equipment, people, and works –
there is always a certain amount of background noise. (For more information
on the concept, check out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal-to-noise_ratio">this article</a>.)</p>

<p>In an ideal world, all equipment would be flawless and noiseless, everyone
would be wonderful at what they do, and all works would be exceptional 
<em>(don’t mind the inherent logical issue in the statement “all works would be
exceptional”; I was trying to make a point, so please forgive me my
linguistic foibles)</em>. As it so happens, due to a fun little thing called the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect">Dunning-Krueger Effect</a>,
we tend to assume that our works are better than they actual are, until we
reach a particular skill level, at which point we start underestimating our
own skill levels. Succinctly put, we’re all terrible at figuring out how good
or bad we are at any particular skill.</p>

<p>This is a real pickle, especially when dealing with other people. With very
few exceptions, we’re going to end up working with other people. This is more
applicable in cinematography than in photography, since there are usually more
people involved with a film production than with a still photo shoot (although
I’m sure there are plenty of instances which would prove me wrong in that
aspect). </p>

<p><em>I’m going to restrict my examples to cinematography projects, to keep
this a bit more manageable and readable.</em></p>

<p>First, look at your potential crew. If you’re dealing with a low-budget indie
shoot, which most of us are, you are either not paying your crew or are paying
them very little money. You’ve already eliminated the possibility of a great
number of highly experienced, educated, and trained people being involved,
simply by eliminating the carrot of a serious payday. It could be additionally
argued that those who do work for a living are not necessarily <em>great</em> at
what they do, but that’s a little tangential to the core of the argument.
Out of those people, you’re generally going to tend to see the talent curve
follow the infamous <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/NormalDistribution.html">standard/normal distribution curve</a>.
This means some will be utterly atrocious, some will be genius, and the
vast majority will lie somewhere between those two points. The outliers and
bounds will depend on the sample size, but the general concept tends to be
the same, which is that most people are not going to possess genius-level
skills in the vast majority of a sample set.</p>

<p>Second, look at your potential actors/on-screen talent. You’re in the same
boat as you were with the crew – except that a single truly terrible actor
will destroy the illusion you’re trying to create, so you have to hope that
your lower bound is pretty high, otherwise your end product will most likely
suffer. (It should also be said that a really great director has been known
to coax amazing performances out of lackluster talent, but we can’t all be
Stanley Kubrick, Darren Aronofsky, or P.T. Anderson…)</p>

<p>So, what are we to do? We need to start acknowledging that not everything
we’re going to make is going to be the best thing <strong>ever</strong>. It’s an anathema
to the general self-aggrandizing L.A. film culture, but we have to respect
the normal distribution curve – most films will be mediocre, some will be
agonizingly bad, and some will be amazing. The DKE means we’ll always think
that they’re all amazingly wonderful, but we need to be far more critical of
our own works ; at least, if we want to try to produce high-quality output.</p>

<p>We also need to understand that there’s a place for our hubris, as well as
our humility. We cannot grow as filmmakers, photographers, artists, or as
people, until we both appreciate the skill-set we have, while at the same
time understanding the limits of what we have accomplished right now, and
always striving to produce better, become better, and encourage better. We
can’t all be the <strong>best</strong>, but we can all become <strong>better</strong>.</p>

    <updated>2013-10-13T20:01:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://jbuchbinder.com/2013/10/13/preparing-for-and-recovering-from-disaster</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the greatest nightmares associated with digital cinematography and
photography is that of the specter of data loss. The very notion that your
carefully planned shots or footage could disappear in a single instant can
be Earth-shattering, since it may not be possible to reshoot (or may be
prohibitively expensive). The best defense is to be prepared, not only for
the possibility that you may lose data, but also to safeguard against that
possibility through preventitive measures.</p>

<h2 id="preparation">Preparation</h2>

<p>There are a number of things you can do to try to protect against data loss,
both before and after shooting has taken place. Here are a few of them:</p>

<p><strong>Don’t use dodgy or off-brand memory cards.</strong> This may seem pretty obvious
to those who have been down this road, but really crappy cards tend to have
dodgy QA processes involved in their manufacture, so although you may get a
good card, you’re just as likely to get a dud – which could end up with your
data. I’ve found that “Amazon Basics” and “KomputerBay” cards have failed me
pretty regularly. Even “Transcend” cards have been pretty dodgy for me, on
occasion. I tend to stick with “SanDisk” branded cards, when I use SD media,
and there are a few decent manufacturers of CF media (Lexar, SanDisk, etc),
which tend to produce quality cards, in my experience.</p>

<p><strong>Storage media doesn’t last forever.</strong> Every piece of flash media has a
certain number of R/W cycles before it becomes unstable and/or unusable.
After a period of time, you might want to start regularly replacing your
media cards to avoid the possibility that errors will begin to occur. It’s
also a good idea to low-level format the cards in between uses, which
supposedly increases their lifespan.</p>

<p><strong>A single physical copy of your product is a bad idea.</strong> If you just move
files off to your laptop harddrive, you’re practically expecting something
to destroy your media. A single SSD or spinning platter in a laptop is a
prime target for an accident to wipe out your data. Ideally, a RAID
(<em>R</em>edundant <em>A</em>rray of <em>I</em>nexpensive <em>D</em>isks) array would provide a
good tradeoff between inexpensive media and redundant storage. I built a
pretty inexpensive one with the following components:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://amzn.to/19EmtYA">Sans Digital MR2UT+ MobileRAID</a>: A two-disk
enclosure, which, when set to RAID-1, gives you a set of mirrored
hard disks, accessible by USB 3.0 or an eSATA interface.</li>
  <li><a href="http://amzn.to/19IlAdp">Seagate Barracuda 2 TB HDD</a>: Two of these
disks will provide you with a total of 2 TB of redundant storage.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>A single physical location is a bad idea.</strong> Consider off-site backup. If
you don’t have the money to store your data in <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">S3</a>
or a similar service, consider using something like
<a href="http://labs.bittorrent.com/experiments/sync.html">Bittorrent Sync</a>, with a
friend or two providing remote backup locations. If this isn’t feasible,
periodically backing up to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Linear_Tape">DLT</a>
or another backup tape, then storing that offsite, may be useful. If you
are questioning “why do I need off-site backup”, just remember that a single
fire or natural disaster can destroy all of your hard work…</p>

<p><strong>Camera-based writing solutions.</strong> Certain cameras (the Canon EOS 5D
Mark III, for example) have multiple media card slots, and have the ability
to write multiple copies of the same media. This can help circumvent the
tragic circumstance (to which I have fallen victim) of a completed shoot
with the inability to read any of the captured data later on. To understand
this, <a href="http://protogtech.com/cameras/canon-5d-mark-iii-record-separately-vs-record-to-multiple-performance-comparison/">read more here</a>.
It should be noted that there are some performance limitations to this,
but if you’re not shooting RAW video and your camera body can handle this,
you might want to seriously consider it.</p>

<h2 id="recovery">Recovery</h2>

<p>There is a pantheon of free and open-source software suites which provide
recovery of lost files, deleted files, destroyed partitions, etc. The true
nightmare scenario would involve a piece of damaged media, from which the
data cannot be extracted – but never assume this unless you have exhausted
all other avenues of recovery.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/PhotoRec">PhotoRec/Testdisk</a> (Open source,
Linux/Windows/Mac/DOS/etc). This is one of my favorites, although it
may potentially require some fairly in-depth technical expertise to
fully exploit its potential.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.piriform.com/recuva">Recuva</a> (Freeware, Windows). Recovers
deleted files.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.hirensbootcd.org">Hiren’s Boot CD</a> (Freeware, Boot Disc).
Hiren’s is a classic recovery and utility boot disk, which can be
booted on any Intel-based computer. The download is free, and it has
a very comprehensive suite of recovery tools. If you don’t have a copy
of this disc hanging around your studio or house – why not?</li>

<p>Hopefully, this will either make it easier to avoid potential data loss, or
at least help to minimize the impact, if and when you end up losing data.</p>

    <link href="http://jbuchbinder.com/2013/09/30/composing-for-aspect-ratios/"/>
    <updated>2013-09-30T20:13:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://jbuchbinder.com/2013/09/30/composing-for-aspect-ratios</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Aspect ratios, simply put (for those who are unaware), are the ratios between
the width and height of a single frame of video. Television has had a 4:3
ratio (4 units of width to 3 units of height), until the popularization of
“HD” television, using a “widescreen” ratio of 16:9. I’m not going to go
through the entire history of aspect ratios in cinema, as there is a
<a href="http://vimeo.com/68830569">great retrospective available on vimeo</a>.</p>

<div class="embed-video-container"><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/68830569 "></iframe></div>

<p>Most DSLR cinematography is done, by default, with a 16:9 ratio, as the
maximum capture size for their video is generally 1920x1080, abbreviated as
1080p (to additionally indicate progressive, rather than interlaced, scan).
It is relatively easy to enforce a “wider” aspect ratio by dropping lines at
the top and bottom of the frame, which most watch-at-home film viewers will
identify as “black bars” at the top and bottom of the frame. This does,
however, introduce an interesting issue – that of composing inside that
frame. That ends up looking something like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://jbuchbinder.com/images/black-bars-aspect-ratio-16-9-21-9-4-3-cinemawide.png" alt="Black bars for different aspect ratios" title="Black bars for different aspect ratios" /></p>

<p>Standard compositional rules generally make use of the two frame diagonals
(top left to bottom right, and bottom left to top right) and both horizontal
and vertical thirds. Most compositional choices for “balanced” frames have
tended to rely on these invisible divisions to create a pleasing image, even
though the rules are really <em>guidelines</em>, and are not absolute. If you, as
a cinematographer, decide that you’re going to use an alternate aspect ratio,
you cannot properly compose by using the thirds or diagonals indicated by any
common guide or viewfinder in 16:9 ratio, as they will result in a vastly
skewed product, compared to the original on-camera image. I’ve seen a number
of forums on DSLR cinematography which had suggested everything from
using a black marker to denote the frame to using black tape to cover the
segments outside of the final crop. A more “modern” solution for Canon
DSLR owners is using <a href="http://magiclantern.wikia.com/wiki/Cropmarks">Magic Lantern cropmarks</a>.
If you’re shooting with another DSLR brand, you may be at the mercy of the
firmware, or any of the aforementioned hacks.</p>

<p><em>NOTE: I’d like to mention, at this point in this article, that there are
other compositional rules, including <a href="http://photoinf.com/Golden_Mean/Eugene_Ilchenko/GoldenSection.html">golden ratio/mean/spiral/rectangle</a>,
so please don’t take the rule of thirds and diagonals to be the only important
and pleasing ways to frame an image….</em></p>

<p>Besides attempting to find a way to follow common compositional rules, there
is another side to aspect ratio: selecting the appropriate one for the story
you are attempting to tell. Apart from the 16:9 ratio being the “standard
format” for HDTV broadcasts and web-based series, it is much taller (i.e.,
it offers more headroom for shots) than Cinemascope (2.35:1) or some of the
other aspect ratios. Depending on the types of shots which you are using to
compose your film, it may be advantageous to have a wider, yet thinner,
view of the world which comes with “shorter” aspect ratios. Again there is
no “one size fits all” for aspect ratios, and it should be a conscious
decision for the material which you are filming.</p>

<p>An added advantage to using a shorter aspect ratio is that, due to the
camera bodies recording the entire frame, regardless of target aspect
ratio, additional editing and recomposition “wiggle room” is available in
the editing and post-production process. If something isn’t framed in the
exact way it should be, this can be corrected later by adjusting the vertical
positioning of the frame within the crop. Most (if not all) NLE software
has vertical positioning, including
<a href="http://help.adobe.com/en_US/premierepro/cs/using/WSC7A162B6-6EF1-49e1-8622-8127366710BB.html">Adobe Premiere</a>,
<a href="http://vegasaur.com/pan-crop-assistant">Sony Vegas</a>,
and <a href="http://www.peachpit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1677950&amp;seqNum=8">Final Cut Pro</a>,
so you shouldn’t have any issues doing this. I’m aware that the ideal
cinematographer does everything in-camera (as I have vociferously
advocated in past), and does not rely on post-production to fix mistakes,
this does allow for that possibility.</p>

<p>Aspect ratios additionally carry some subconscious baggage with them, due
to the associations we have made with previous material filmed using them,
much in the same way we associate film grain with high-end Hollywood
pictures, even when, in many cases, that film grain was added back to
the digital footage in post-production.</p>

<p>The quick takeaway is that you shouldn’t embark on a project without having
made a conscious decision regarding the aspect ratio which you are using for
that project, considered the ramifications and technical concerns associated
with that decision (including making sure that you can properly frame and
compose shots in that aspect ratio), and storyboarded and/or prepared your
material considering your chosen aspect ratio. It is yet another variable
which can be tweaked to help make an already good project that much better,
and like all power, it comes with responsibility. So, choose –
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF2UrYSDb3k">but choose wisely</a>, and as
always, good luck!</p>

    <link href="http://jbuchbinder.com/2013/09/19/on-documentary-filming/"/>
    <updated>2013-09-19T16:58:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://jbuchbinder.com/2013/09/19/on-documentary-filming</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently had the pleasure of shooting for a documentary down in
Birmingham, AL, about one of the people involved in the 
<a href="http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/civilrights/al11.htm">16th Street Baptist Church Bombing</a>
in 1963. For those who don’t know, that event was one of the most
important parts of the Civil Rights movement in the 1960s. The
50th anniversary of the bombing was this September (2013), so I had
gone with a small film crew to cover the event, and interview some of
the people involved.</p>

<p>I had never shot documentary footage, apart from some small controlled
one-on-one interviews, so this was an interesting learning experience for
me. I’d like to share some of the more important things which I learned
over the course of my experience down there.</p>

<p><strong>Batteries</strong>. You’re going to run out of them. I ran through four batteries
over the course of a filming day – which I thought would be enough, but
weren’t. If you have one thing which requires a strange and unique battery,
you should have at least one spare, even if it’s new. Someone is invariably
going to leave something on, chew up the battery, and leave you short a
vital piece of equipment. If you’re shooting with a DSLR, try to get a
multi-battery grip, so that you don’t have to change batteries as often.</p>

<p><strong>One Shot</strong>. You only have <em>one shot</em> to get event coverage correctly,
which means that, ideally, you should be covering from more than one angle,
to provide not only options in editing, but some sort of redundancy.
Otherwise, you can easily be left with a serious dearth of footage for
what could be a vital part.</p>

<p><strong>Focus and Calibration</strong>. Get there early, get set up, get everything
metered and working properly <em>before</em> things start moving. You really can’t
easily recalibrate during taping without potentially ruining footage. Did
I forget to mention that you only get <em>one shot</em> with event footage?</p>

<p><strong>Depth of Field: More is Better</strong>. You’re not shooting an art piece, you’re
trying to cover something which probably only happens once, so you shouldn’t
be shooting at f/2.8 or something ridiculous like that. Yes, you can sometimes
take advantage of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperfocal_distance">hyperfocal distance</a>
of a lens to keep far-away objects in focus – but you should, most likely,
find a fairly closed aperture to work with. This can be challenging in low
light scenarios, where you’ll be fighting the specter of sensor noise at
extremely high ISO levels when you close the iris more than a little.</p>

<p><strong>Positivity</strong>. You need to be happy and in a good place when shooting people
and interviews, especially in a one-on-one setting. Other people take certain
cues from your body language and demeanor, and hostility will produce
hostility. If at all possible, try to work on documentary projects which you
like, or identify with.</p>

<p><strong>Lens Changes</strong>. If you can avoid it, don’t. Wear cargo pants or a vest with
lens pockets, much like most photographers, if you absolutely <em>must</em> change
lenses. If you’re shooting a long distance, go with something like the
<a href="http://amzn.to/14nI8Cm">Canon EF 70-200mm f/2.8L IS II USM</a> lens, or if you
are dealing with shorter distances, the
<a href="http://amzn.to/189gQmi">Canon EF 24-70mm f/2.8L II USM</a> lens. Carrying a few
primes around will work well for static interview shots, but they’re going to
be a real pain when you’re dealing with moving targets, no matter how quick
you are with focus peaking assistance. If you’re shooting with a shoulder rig,
you’re going to want an IS/VR lens, if you have one available – it cuts down
on a lot of shudder and shake.</p>

<p><strong>Bring a Spare</strong>. Got one lav mic? You might want to bring a second one.
If there’s a small piece of equipment or accessory which, if missing, could
screw you, it’s going to go missing. Especially when you’re far from home
base and without the benefit of an equipment store.</p>

<p><strong>You’re Going To Mess Up</strong>. This is pretty obvious – no matter how careful
you are, something is going to get messed up. The trick is to try to make
everything redundant enough that it doesn’t matter.</p>

<p><strong>It’s Not About Your Equipment</strong>. Someone there is going to have a better
camera, better lenses, and better <em>everything</em> than you have. Go far enough,
and your rig is going to look bad to someone. Just remember, you’re there for
a reason, so know your equipment, and use it as well as you can.</p>

<p><strong>Rocking Out</strong>. If you’re interviewing someone who is rocking back and forth,
bring it to their attention. It creates massive focusing, framing, and
perspective issues. Don’t be intimidated; they can rock as much as they’d
like, just as soon as you’re done filming.</p>

<p><strong>Network</strong>. If you’re looking for an interview with someone, talking to
some of the people around them may lead you to another interviewee who may
produce even better results. There’s no cost associated with being polite.</p>

<p><strong>Respect the Eyeline</strong>. For static interviews, don’t shoot up or down on
someone’s eye-line unless you are trying to indicate something about that
person. You should be even with their eye-line on initial shot setup. This
is also a good idea when doing non-static interviews, when possible.</p>

<p><strong>Make Two Copies</strong>. When you transfer the data off of your memory cards,
make two copies, and if possible, don’t transport them together. Redundancy
is the name of the game here, since even the best footage means diddly/squat
if no one ever gets to see it.</p>

<p><strong>Bring a Sound Guy</strong>. I know, you don’t think you need one – you’ve got a
lav mic, right? A sound engineer is half of your production, since you’re in
charge of the visuals. Also, boom mic operators generally should be fairly
competent sound engineers, to avoid issues later on in the post-production
process – when possible.</p>

<p><strong>Don’t Go For The Cheaper Chicken</strong>. When booking accommodations, don’t go
for the least expensive hotel – there’s a good chance that it’s in a dodgy
part of town, and that extra 10 dollars a night might buy you not only a
bit of security, but might buy you a better night’s sleep. Protip: the
cheapest hotel is generally right next to a) train tracks with 24-hour train
service, b) an open-air coal mine, c) a condemned house with mysterious
block parties at all hours of the night, or d) all of the above…</p>

<p><strong>Get Stills</strong>. If you’re doing a documentary with a bunch of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Burns_effect">Ken Burns effect</a> style
picture montages, you should try to either take stills yourself, or have
another camera operator capture some for you. If you can, attempt to take
pictures of landmarks or buildings when they are not occupied, unless it
specifically works in your storytelling to have them occupied or surrounded.</p>

<p>There are many, many more things to think about when it comes to filming
documentaries and documentary footage – but hopefully, these bullet points
will help someone else avoid some of the pitfalls I experienced on my first
documentary shoot. Good luck!</p>

    <link href="http://jbuchbinder.com/2013/09/10/are-you-a-cinematographer-or-a-camera-operator/"/>
    <updated>2013-09-10T21:55:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://jbuchbinder.com/2013/09/10/are-you-a-cinematographer-or-a-camera-operator</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There’s only a slight difference in the textbook definition between a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinematographer">cinematographer</a> and a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_operator">camera operator</a>. Besides the
slight variance in responsibilities (a cinematographer/DP can be responsible
for several camera operators), there are some additional skills and
aptitudes which play into the decision to try to be a cinematographer.</p>

<p>None of this is meant to downplay the skill and experience which make a
great camera operator. Knowing your equipment, being able to choose the
proper lenses and camera settings, being able to operate that equipment,
being able to interpret the direction of both the director and the
cinematographer, and being able to hold together a cohesive shot –
these are all the hallmarks of a great camera operator.</p>

<p>At a much, much more basic level, there’s an <em>art</em> to cinematography, which
transcends the physical manipulations of the equipment involved, and becomes
more about creating a sort of separate reality; that of capturing a little
slice of time and space, motion and stillness, light and dark, vibrant
colors and subtle undertones. That’s the part of this that, to me, offers
the most promising creativity and the most fulfilling, yet burdening, tasks.</p>

<p>It’s very easy to get lost in the minutiae of camera settings adjustments,
equipment acquisition, troubleshooting and stabilization, among other
demons – but the <em>art</em> is the derivative of those functions.</p>

<p>To properly illustrate this, I think of a concert I attended, quite a few
years ago. The guitarist, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/VernonReid">Vernon Reid</a>,
was (and still is), an amazing technical instrumentalist. I watched him dance
over the semi-circle of effects pedals and boxes, his hands moving,
seemingly effortlessly over the six strings on his instrument. It struck me
as astounding. We are all, in some way, capable of recognizing genius and
immense skill, even if we cannot reproduce it, or explain it in purely
quantifiable terms. In that way, the body of his technical skills simply
became a foundation for the <em>art</em> which was made by way of them. I wish I
could explain it better – I only know that I could recognize it when I saw
it. The man himself, whom I had the pleasure of speaking with for a few
brief moments, was very humble and very “zen” about his skill and his art.</p>

<p>Due to my particular circumstances, I’ve been able to pick and choose projects,
more of late, specifically based on their relative merits to me. As such, I
haven’t had much experience acting strictly as a “camera operator”. There
may be some hubris, on my part, which would have come out of getting to
perform the artistic duties of a cinematographer on the vast majority of the
projects on which I’ve been involved. It has given me an affinity for the
creative aspects of the job. For as long as I’ve been involved with
cinematography, I have always assumed that being a “camera operator” has been
a step towards being a cinematographer; a way of honing the technical
foundation of the craft, so that the art can come later. It seemed like an
“apprenticeship”, much as the old focus pullers became second unit
cameramen, to eventually move up to first units, then perhaps aspire to
become a cinematographer one day…</p>

<p>The landscape, mostly due to the explosion of low-cost cinematography
(fueled primarily by DSLR cinematography), has been shifting away from that
old model. Most projects have one, perhaps two camera operators – and the
primary camera operator is usually the cinematographer/DP. Many projects
don’t even <em>have</em> a second camera operator – it simply isn’t required.</p>

<p>Ultimately, it depends what your plans and/or revenue model is.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you want to learn more about how to get your equipment to perform
the way you want it to perform, you may do well working as a camera
operator with a seasoned cinematographer, rather than holding out for
a DP position on a project.</li>
  <li>If you want to make a living behind a camera, you can’t really differentiate
between cinematography and camera operator work – at least as long as
you want to keep a steady revenue stream up. Even the best cinematographers
can moonlight as strict “camera operators” when the pay is right.</li>
  <li>If you want to work in a lower pressure environment, you might want to
be a camera operator. Cinematographers are responsible for everything
visual which goes on in a project, and it can be a lot of stress.</li>
  <li>If you feel passionate enough about a project to want to be involved at
any cost, you might sign on as a camera operator.</li>
</ul>

<p>Even though there’s a lot of competition for certain spots on certain
projects, we’re all on the same team; we all (for the most part) are
interested in shooting great footage, and many of us are concerned about
creating enduring works of art, wherever possible. We all have great
potential for growth, so whatever your career and job choice, good luck!</p>

    <link href="http://jbuchbinder.com/2013/09/10/prime-lenses-and-proper-depth-of-field/"/>
    <updated>2013-09-10T13:24:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://jbuchbinder.com/2013/09/10/prime-lenses-and-proper-depth-of-field</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Depth of field is a massively misunderstood “side effect” of iris size, and
an ultimately useful storytelling tool (when used properly).</p>

<p>DSLR photography has spawned a large group of cinematographers who are
dealing with largely light-insensitive camera sensors (usually producing
fairly unacceptable noise when used at greater sensitivies than ISO 800).
This has created a need for “fast” lenses, which are lenses which have very
large maximum apertures, featuring maximum f-stop ratings like f/2.0, f/1.8,
and even f/1.4 (there are even some <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/news/2013/08/06/kubrick-s-f-0-7-lenses-now-available-for-rent-but-start-saving-up">f/0.7 lenses</a> out there, but I’m
sticking to the realm of affordable DSLR cinematography, at the moment).
Using firmware like <a href="http://magiclantern.fm/">Magic Lantern</a> allows us to use
focus peaking to exploit manual-focus and non-EF mount lenses (for those
Canon-philes among us), to bring down the effective cost of shooting “fast”
lenses. I have some M42 “Pentax screw-mount” lenses which open to f/2.8 –
acquired for less than 10 USD each, plus a 7 USD <a href="http://amzn.to/1fVPGyf">M42-to-EF adapter ring</a>.
If you’re interested in more information on how to use focus peaking, check
out <a href="http://fstoppers.com/using-magic-lantern-with-focus-peaking-for-free-lensing">how it works</a>.</p>

<p>So, you’ve beaten high-cost DSLR and cinema camera body manufacturers by
using “fast” lenses, right? Well, not so fast, there… You have to consider
the <em>side effect</em> of fast lenses and wide apertures: the shallow depth of
field. It’s both a blessing and a curse; we tend to associate shallow depth
of field images and video with expensive equipment (rightfully so, in most
cases) and a more personal type of image, but those lenses are not
universally usable “wide open”. Many shots come off looking amateurish and
ill-composed, when half of the subjects are out of focus, because they’ve
exceeded the edges of the “sharp” area in the focus range.</p>

<p>(There’s also lack of lens sharpness and chromatic abberation to consider,
which are generally present, to some degree, in the widest aperture settings
available on most lenses. That’s a very intensely technical discussion,
however, and will probably be reserved for a future posting.)</p>

<p>When considering the depth of field you want, consider the subject (or
literal <em>focus</em>) of the shot, and figure out how much of the shot needs to
be in focus to properly tell your story. The depth of field is very
important for exposing the mise-en-scène in the way which best represents
both the explicit visuals and external representation of internal
character development and exposition. If your character needs to “pop”
out of the scenery, a narrow DOF would be perfect – but if they are to
appear as a figurative cog in the machinery of the world, you’re probably
going to be looking for the widest DOF (approaching infinity) as you can
get. When widening the DOF like this, you’ll most likely have to compensate
by boosting the ambient lighting, or adding additional lighting, to
adjust for the decreased light hitting your camera sensor.</p>

<p>There are a number of tools for figuring out the proper DOF for a certain
shot, based on the camera/sensor, lens focal length, and distance to
primary focal point.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.dofmaster.com/dofjs.html">Web-based DOF calculator</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.dofmaster.com/android.html">Android calculator</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.dofmaster.com/iphone.html">iOS calculator</a></li>
</ul>

<p>There are more of them, but if you specify the variables, you can adjust
the aperture f-stop to the widest setting which properly fits the scene
and visuals which you’re attempting to achieve.</p>

<p>Like anything else, this isn’t strictly an instructional A-to-B guide on
how to achieve stunning visuals; it’s simply an attempt to share some of
what I’ve learned, and to help share the knowledge and tools to exploit
your own inner artistic vision. Good luck shooting!</p>

    <link href="http://jbuchbinder.com/2013/09/07/to-post-or-not-to-post/"/>
    <updated>2013-09-07T13:18:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://jbuchbinder.com/2013/09/07/to-post-or-not-to-post</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Even though a good portion of the work has been completed when you press the
shutter button, or stop rolling, since all of your planning and execution has
been completed, there’s still a final step (or series of steps) to bring that
artistic effort to a presentable format.</p>

<p>Many people shoot with default (or very close to default) settings on their
camera or videocamera, and do simple “post production” by simply cropping or
cutting whatever comes out of their camera body. This is a very “purist” way
of going about shooting, but can also rob your end product of some of the
polish and slight adjustments which can take good pictures or footage and
make them into something extraordinary.</p>

<p>All of that being said, there’s a limit to the types and amounts of post
production which can and should be used, much in the way that overproducing
a musical album can result in a homogenous and lifeless product, robbed of
the “soul” and variances which make it unique. You are the only person who
can decide how much, if any, post processing is right for your project or
other artistic endeavor.</p>

<p><strong>RAW versus JPEG/H.264</strong></p>

<p>With DSLR cameras being used for both photography and cinematography, there
are places where the “processing” aspect can be pushed off into the post
production process.</p>

<p>For photography, RAW format pictures can allow recovery past some of the
previously accepted limits of what would normally be considered lost or
unusable. Effectively, it allows you to make the decisions which are
normally pushed off on your camera’s processor (the DIGIC processor(s),
for all of you Canon users). It adds an additional step to the
post-processing workflow, in that you’ll need a piece of software like
<a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom.html">Adobe Lightroom</a> for Windows/Mac users, or if you’re a Linux user like me,
<a href="http://rawstudio.org/">Raw Studio</a>. It also adds a significant amount of time to the
photographic post-processing workflow, in that there are a number of
additional parameters which can be adjusted, which would normally result
in image degradation, but can be adjusted in RAW images with little or no
deleterious effect. If you’re a <a href="http://www.magiclantern.fm/">Magic Lantern</a> user, you can also
experiment with “dual ISO” images, which can create images with enormous
dynamic range through sensor tricks – but which adds an another step
before RAW processing, that of running a CR2HDR binary. (If you’re
interested in trying this out, but don’t want to compile a CR2HDR binary
for Windows or Linux, I have binaries available <a href="https://bitbucket.org/rufustfirefly/magic-lantern/downloads">here</a>)</p>

<p>For cinematography, there’s a lot more to think about. Magic Lantern users
of Canon 5Dmk3 models (and some others, as well) have the option of being
able to shoot RAW video with some very fast CF cards. This adds a pretty
substantial amount of post-processing steps <em>before</em> your NLE (non-linear
editor) of choice enters the picture. There are a pretty wide swath of
applications which now support the Magic Lantern RAW format, including
<a href="http://www.magiclantern.fm/forum/index.php?action=printpage;topic=5557.0">RAWanizer</a>, but your best bet is to get involved with the Magic
Lantern forum if you want to begin working with a RAW workflow. The other
serious disadvantage is storage space. Standard H.264 video, which is
shot by most DSLR camera bodies, has issues with some digital artifacts in
certain scenarios, as well as some dynamic range issues (some of which can
be made better by use of flat color profiles like <a href="https://www.technicolorcinestyle.com/download/">Cinestyle</a>, but I’ll
leave that for later) – but it produces fairly compact files, even at
1080p/24p (1920x1080 24fps progressive) resolution. RAW data can take
upwards of a gigabyte of space every 15-20 seconds. Your storage media
and backup solutions have to be able to deal with that, so it’s something
to seriously consider before deciding to move a project to work with that
format.</p>

<p><strong>White Balance</strong></p>

<p>It used to be accepted that white balancing (determining where “true white”
lies in an image, compensating for varying light color temperatures) had to
be done “in camera”, before shots were taken. There are a number of tools
which allow this to be done in post-processing.</p>

<p>Photographers can do this when shooting with RAW camera images very
simply, as most RAW image processors have a simple white balancing tool. It’s
still possible to do this with processed JPEG images, but with the
potential for losing some image data. Depending on how comfortable you are
with straying from the “truest possible image”, you can decide where you
feel comfortable dealing with white balancing.</p>

<p>Cinematographers have a pretty vast array of white balancing and color
correction plugins available for their NLE of choice. I’m most familiar with
Adobe Premiere, so I’d mention <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/VideoRoad/2010/05/using_the_fast_color_corrector.html">Fast Color Corrector</a> and
<a href="http://philipbloom.net/forum/threads/tutorial-color-grading-and-styling-with-colorista-ii.2528/">Red Giant Colorista II</a>, both of which offer pretty decent white
balancing capabilities, among other things. If you’re concerned about
render speed, Fast Color Corrector seems to win out against Colorista II,
but Colorista II has some additional parameters and capabilities which
far outstrip what FCC has to offer. There’s also software like
<a href="http://tv.adobe.com/watch/learn-premiere-pro-cc/color-grading-premiere-pro-sequences-in-speedgrade/">Adobe Speedgrade</a> and <a href="http://digitalfilms.wordpress.com/2013/02/02/davinci-resolve-workflows/">Blackmagic Design Davinci Resolve</a>, both
of which offer white balancing, color correction, and color grading
capabilities. There are a few threads <a href="http://forums.planet5d.com/threads/123505-Adobe-Speedgrade-vs-DaVinci-Resolve">comparing the two of them</a>.</p>

<p>The important distinction is whether or not you want to spend the time
to properly white balance your images or footage before you take pictures.
It’s not always condusive to your shooting workflow to do so, and if this
is a factor, you should seriously consider some of the post-processing
options. It’s obviously to your greatest advantage to have the most
accurate input images/footage to bring into your post-processing
workflow, but sometimes it’s not pragmatic to take a completely purist
attitude in this regard.</p>

<p><strong>Exposure</strong></p>

<p>We’ve all been bitten by changing light conditions, unexpected events, or
incorrect metering producing images or footage which has exposure problems.
If you’re shooting RAW (or using Magic Lantern’s Dual ISO hack), this is
an ideal place to examine using post-processing to correct these issues.</p>

<p>We would all like to properly expose everything (unless we have a
particular artistic reason for doing otherwise, since in the art of
photography or cinematography, there are generally exceptions to every
rule, rules were made to be broken, etc), but taking a post-processing
detour to correct such things is generally preferable to re-arranging a
shoot.</p>

<p><strong>Special Effects</strong></p>

<p>I’m not a big fan of post-processing special effects, mainly because I 
am a proponent of the idea that it takes some of the artistry out of
pulling off those same effects “in camera”. I do understand that there
are certain effects which would be either very difficult or downright
impossible to achieve without the use of computer generated effects –
but there’s a lot of things which can be accomplished <em>without</em> that.</p>

<p>Lighting is something which I’ve seen done in post, which generally
baffles me. It’s something which is pretty simple to execute properly,
given a little time and effort. Saving images or footage with issues
might be a good use for that, but it’s probably not something I would
recommend doing for everyday editing and processing.</p>

<p>For example, having someone “eaten” by light can be accomplished for
a cinematographer, simply by adjusting the fill light to blow out the
whites, then opening the iris of the lens (using a focus pulling kit,
or just a spare hand, for the less equipment-heavy among us) to allow
the fill light to “eat” the remainder of the image. That can be done
without any specific post-processing.</p>

<p><strong>Flat Color Profiles</strong></p>

<p>This is pretty much for cinematographers, since photographers could
simply take RAW photos – and cinematographers shooting RAW should
probably ignore this section, as well.</p>

<p>There are quite a few “flat color profiles” available for DSLR
(and other) bodies, such as the aforementioned Technicolor Cinestyle
profile and the <a href="http://www.similaar.com/foto/flaat-picture-styles/long-1.html">Flaat Picture Style</a>. These work by effectively
increasing the dynamic range being captured by the camera by storing
the values differently than the stock picture profile.</p>

<p>I highly recommend shooting with one, if you’re not going to make the
leap to shoot RAW. It does add the additional step in post-processing
of having to adjust the blacks/whites and/or applying a corrective
LUT (look up table) to adjust the end product to look less “washed
out”. There are LUTs and plugins available for virtually every NLE
out there right now – and I suggest learning how to do this. The
improvement in the end product is substantial for relatively little
time investment.</p>

<p><strong>Audio Post</strong></p>

<p>This is another section just for cinematographers.</p>

<p>The audio which is recorded with footage is generally “reference
audio”, which is meant to be replaced by actual audio, generally
recorded with something like a <a href="http://tascam.com/product/dr-40/">Tascam DR-40</a> or <a href="http://www.zoom.co.jp/english/products/h4n/">Zoom H4n</a>
external recorder and a shotgun microphone. It’s far outside the
scope of this to explain the majority of these technologies and
techniques, but sufficed to say that they produce far cleaner and
usable recordings than on-camera audio (even when using augmented
on-camera microphones, etc). If you can afford it, use external
audio, and have an experienced audio engineer perform some basic
post-production on your audio.</p>

<p>If you can’t afford it, or don’t have an audio engineer, there are
a few basic steps to get cleaner audio.</p>

<p>1) <em>Don’t use the microphone built into the camera</em>. It sounds pretty
awful, and is noisy. Get a lav microphone for interviews, or a
directional hot-shoe mounted external microphone for anything else.</p>

<p>2) <em>Adjust the audio levels manually</em>. Automatic level adjustment is
going to be terrible. It’s meant to avoid clipping, but it tends to
make the noise floor (the level of background noise) jump around as
the camera readjusts the audio recording level, so it may make your
life significantly more difficult when it comes time to adjust the
footage later. Adjust it to the loudest sound you’re going to be
recording – then perhaps a click lower, for safety.</p>

<p>3) <em>Respect the inverse square law</em>. For those unfamiliar, sounds
drop at a logarithmic rate as you move away from the sound source,
following the same inverse square law which is used to figure light
source brightness. The closer you are to a recorded sounds, the
cleaner and better the source audio will be. Every object which a
sound hits will produce a “reflection” (much as light does). If that
reflection is equal or louder than the volume of the source sound,
you’re going to get a pretty terrible sounding audio recording.</p>

<p>4) <em>Get the cleanest audio possible</em>. Try to cut down on external
noise sources. Never assume that you can clean something later on;
you should be trying to get clean audio. If something has to be
re-taken to avoid a lawnmower being run in the background, then you
should seriously consider doing it. It’ll save you from pulling out
your hair.</p>

<p>I’m sure that this isn’t a <em>comprehensive</em> list, but hopefully this
will help everyone get started with deciding what, if anything, to
relegate to their post-processing workflow. Good luck!</p>

    <link href="http://jbuchbinder.com/2013/06/28/skill-in-the-age-of-instagram/"/>
    <updated>2013-06-28T15:40:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://jbuchbinder.com/2013/06/28/skill-in-the-age-of-instagram</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I had started a post a few months ago, which I had tentatively titled “Approximating Skill”. It was a fairly scathing indictment of what I had refered to as the “Instagram generation”.</p>

<p>As anyone who has been following my recent posts here knows, I attach a lot of importance to the notion of “skill”, especially in relation to art forms where there are popular misconceptions regarding the ability to “buy” your way into a particular skill-set.</p>

<p>In “<a href="http://jbuchbinder.com/2013/05/03/gear-vs-skill/">Skill vs Gear</a>”, I had tried to explain that, no matter how many toys or additional pieces were added into any mix, the most important variable is the skill of the operator/artist in control of the production. It seems like a fairly simple thing to understand, but in the muddied world of extensive post-production and devalued skill-sets, that common understanding is constantly called into question.</p>

<p>Take <a href="http://instagram.com/">Instagram</a>, for example. It’s a fairly simple concept, being a marriage between Twitter-style <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign">hashtags</a> (don’t get me started on that – we should just call it U+0023 and get it over with), social networking, and cameraphone photography. (I happen to particularly loathe cameraphone photography, except for the ubiquitous and universally available nature of cameraphones.) The issues, as far as I’m concerned, begin to arise in the dual areas of devaluation and lack of appreciation.</p>

<p><strong>Devaluation</strong>. This comes into play when every Instagram (or insert other type of skill-sapping or replacing app here) user begins to assume that they, yes they, are capable of producing professional results. Malcolm Gladwell famously claimed that it took <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book)">10,000 hours</a> of time to amass enough skill to master a certain skill-set. I prefer to refer to <a href="http://enticingthelight.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Stages-of-a-Photographer.png">this chart</a> (ignore some of the strange and inappropriate labels – the sentiment is the important part). As perceived self-skill increases, valuation of others’ skill-sets decreases. This explains much of the reluctance to hire professional photographers and cinematographers/videographers, or to value their skills so little that an insulting amount of compensation is considered “reasonable” for their time and effort.</p>

<p><strong>Lack of appreciation</strong>. Autotune and Instagram are both partially to blame for this – but it seems as though actual skill is barely recognizable anymore, to a vast swath of the population, for any given skill-set. I do understand that the <a href="http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Dunning-Kruger_effect">Dunning-Kruger Effect</a> means that any person is going to assess their own skill-set incorrectly. This, however, reaches far beyond that conclusion. After having been subjected to hundreds, if not thousands, of hours of blown out and ill-colored photos, and subjected to far too many songs which have been pitch corrected beyond human recognition, the latest generation has mostly lost the ability to differentiate between “faked” output and true skill. I recently had an entire photoshoot (which I dutifully handed over to the photographed party) blown out, miscolored, and made to look like a bunch of terrible Instagram photos – all, supposedly, in the name of appealing to the younger generation, as they “appreciate” things that look like that. As far as faked output goes, it’s not limited to amateurs; big budget Hollywood studios have been <a href="http://www.cracked.com/article_18664_5-annoying-trends-that-make-every-movie-look-same.html">exploiting basic digital correction</a> to make everything look the same – the Instagramification of movies (that article also points out the annoying “shaky cam” stuff that I had been discussing in my <a href="http://jbuchbinder.com/2013/06/03/stabilization/">earlier post</a>). In the end, skills fall along the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">standard/normal distribution curve</a>, even if the skills represented by the vertical axis may be logarithmic in scale.</p>

<p><strong>The Hipster Effect</strong>. I realize that I only counted two areas earlier in this post, but this would lack something if I didn’t mention the effect that the “Hipster” culture has had on perceived skills. Rather than reiterate every terrible think about Hipster culture, <a href="http://www.wolfgnards.com/index.php/2010/08/27/the-irony-of-the-ironic-hipsters-don-t-understand-irony">I’ll let this guy do it for me</a>. I don’t know if I can explain this better than <strong>there is no such thing as ironically bad music or photography</strong>. The misconception that there is has very deeply damaged the ability for the average hipster to properly appreciate music and photography, assuming that they are searching for ironically bad things, rather than attempting to appreciate skill. Crummy audio recordings, “vintage looks”, and other gimmicks serve to hide, rather than accentuate, the skills involved in the production of the underlying art.</p>

<p><strong>Processing/Post-Production</strong>. When you do not require initial skill to create something, but can merely “<a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/this-looks-shopped">shop</a>” your way out of any situation, the underlying skill is devalued, and sometimes forgotten. I’ve been trying to emphasize the value of learning to create effects and the vast majority of the cinematic treatment of the mise-en-scène, rather than simply using a series of post-production tools to bend the footage to my will. This has more to do with the propensity for forgetting basic cinematic technique which comes with foregoing the steps involved with figuring out how to do this work on set. The real damnation seems to come when there is <em>no actual knowledge</em> of the underpinnings and workings of the art, and a novice decides to use post-processing <em>exclusive of skill</em>. This is the disease which is Instagram, Autotune, and Photoshop, in a nutshell.</p>

<p>The only way to fight this is to not concede defeat. If we are actually artists instead of simple camera jockeys, why shouldn’t we be pushing for our craft and skill-set to receive the recognition which it deserves? I understand that some of the lost ground, in terms of general appreciation, has been lost – but hopefully we can keep the situation from getting much worse through education and perserverence.</p>

    <link href="http://jbuchbinder.com/2013/06/20/the-age-of-dslr-cinematography/"/>
    <updated>2013-06-20T16:57:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://jbuchbinder.com/2013/06/20/the-age-of-dslr-cinematography</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>DSLR cinematography (the practice of cinematography using relatively inexpensive DSLR camera bodies, which were originally purposed for still photography) has been enjoying a sort of minature renaissance over the last few years.</p>

<p>I was pleasantly surprised to find out that Shane Carruth’s new movie, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2084989/">Upstream Color</a>, was shot entirely on a DSLR body. The information I’ve been reading indicates that he used a Panasonic GH2 DSLR body, with a few lenses, including the <a href="http://slrgear.com/reviews/showproduct.php/product/1577/cat/110">Rokinon 85mm f/1.4</a> (which I highly recommend). It scored at Sundance, and if it hadn’t been for a few “behind the scenes” photos, it might not have been quite that apparent.</p>

<p>Of course, Carruth also ended up using some <a href="http://www.kenrockwell.com/voigtlander/">Voigtlander</a> glass, which is by no stretch of the imagination cheap/affordable for cash-strapped indie filmmakers. There’s an interesting write-up on the whole thing <a href="http://www.eoshd.com/content/10309/gh2-shot-sci-fi-upstream-color-breaks-300000-mark-at-the-us-box-office">at EOSHD</a>.</p>

<p>There’s a reason why I bring up “Upstream Color” – and it’s a point that I’ve been trying to make, off and on, for the past year or so. That film grossed over 300k dollars at the box office, and was shot on a small, inexpensive camera body. Still, it produced stunning visuals and did not seem to suffer from most of the “fatal flaws” that most seem to ascribe to DSLR cinematography, in general. The point, boiled down to its most essential component, is that the most important piece of equipment you’ve got is between your forehead and your nose. You can’t buy your way into it, and you can’t just assume that if you own it, you can shoot as well as cinematographer X who has the current successful movie on the big screen.</p>

<p>Whether or not you’re a big fan of “Act of Valor” or the “Fast and Furious” franchise, you can still appreciate Shane Hurlbut’s <a href="http://blog.planet5d.com/2012/02/act-of-valor-leap-of-faith/">extensive use of Canon EOS 5D mk III bodies</a>. He has had a series of posts on his blog praising not only the relative inexpensive nature of the 5D bodies, but also their versatility.</p>

<p>For every person who says “I shoot on the RED ONE” and produces sub-standard output, or bemoans not being able to afford an ARRI which would “really make a beautiful movie” – I call foul on that entire argument. Even contending with a more limited dynamic range (a common DSLR problem), a top resolution of 1080p for shooting, and mostly commodity lenses, Carruth managed to produce something beautiful. It’s not down to the equipment you buy, folks, it’s how you use it.</p>

<p>Good luck.</p>

    <link href="http://jbuchbinder.com/2013/06/03/stabilization/"/>
    <updated>2013-06-03T14:03:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://jbuchbinder.com/2013/06/03/stabilization</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Cinematography is, first and foremost, an artform. That being said, I’d like to
also emphasize the caveat that it is a <em>technical</em> artform, and requires a
certain degree of skill and/or technical proficiency to be able to consistently
create artful work. </p>

<p>It could be argued that no, this isn’t the case, based solely on the
promulgation of iDevice and consumer-grade video device footage. This type of
footage does not require a modicum of skill, or even practice. In the same way
that it is possible to take a fantastic picture with an Android or iOS device,
it is <em>possible</em> to film usable content with a consumer grade device – but
not only is it technically limiting (based on the sensors, alone), but it
offers virtually no control over the footage, other than some basic focus and
exposure controls. I would argue that the resulting footage could result in
decent quality output if either a) the operator had an artistic eye, and was
able to use their technology with some skill/proficiency, or b) they were
extremely lucky. However, I digress.</p>

<p>One of the most consistently over-used (and misused, incidentally) is
“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinéma_vérité">cinéma vérité</a>”. In modern cinematographer parlance, it has come to mean
any footage which resembles that of an unskilled operator, which theoretically
lends an air of realism and observationalism (see any first year film school
book on observational cinema if you’re unfamiliar with the concept) to a
piece. It’s easier, for example, to immerse a viewer in the world of a
Zombie Apocalypse if they feel as though they could be the one sitting behind
the camera.</p>

<p>This concept has been expanded, partially through the over-saturation of
“<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_television">reality television</a>” and “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Found_footage_(genre)">found footage</a>” genre pieces. Far from
being necessitated by the artistic content of those genres, it is rather
<a href="http://alifetimeindarkrooms.blogspot.com/2012/02/okay-for-pitys-sake-enough-with-found.html">much more profitable</a>, and can be executed with far crummier equipment
and with a lower technical skill (and ostensibly artistic skill) element. I’m
not going to argue that there is <em>no</em> artistic or technical skill involved
in making either of those genres of television or film, as that would be
foolhardy – and there are always exceptions to the general rule.</p>

<p>Cinéma vérité is a bit more troubling when used as an excuse for technical
incompetence, lack of technique, or lack of foresight and caring. Most
recently, I’ve heard shaky and unstabilized footage “explained away” as
being necessitated by the genre of cinéma vérité – and I’m not buying that
excuse. The majority of footage in film can and should be stabilized, as
well as planned out and executed in a thoughtful manner. That’s where the
“art” of cinematography lies; otherwise, you’re just a camera jockey, no
matter how fancy your equipment may be. As I’ve said before, the most
important piece of equipment you own is your eye; everything else just helps
your execution.</p>

<p>There is no excuse for shaky footage in this age of
<a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/consumer/standard_display/Lens_Advantage_IS">image stabilization systems</a> and <a href="http://littlegreatideas.com/stabilizer/diy/">inexpensive stabilizers</a> which you
can build for a few dollars worth of parts from your local home improvement
store. It adds a lot of cinematographic value and apparent production value
to have more stable shots. I’d prefer not to experience vertigo when watching
a simple walking tracking shot, when possible. One of my favorite “why the
hell did that guy do that” moments was in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119173/">G.I. Jane</a> (of which I’m not
a fan), where the combat scenes are filmed with what appears to be
<em>intentional</em> camera shake. Far from transporting the viewer into the middle
of the morass, it only conveys confusion and vertigo. Used in more moderate
amounts, it could have proved much more effective, in my opinion.</p>

<p>Even if you’re dead-set on the idea of making your next film project using
the “cinéma vérité” genre, there are a few things you should consider before
proceeding unstabilized:</p>

<ol>
  <li><em>Does this somehow add to the feel of the film?</em> If you are introducing
camera shake into your cinematography, it should be adding something
tangible, like a certain feeling, to a scene.</li>
  <li><em>Am I overusing this?</em> If you’re shooting every shot this way, you might
want to reconsider your methodology, unless you’re shooting a guerilla
documentary.</li>
  <li><em>Am I doing this due to a technical limitation?</em> If you are using
“cinéma vérité” as an excuse for being unable to stabilize your footage,
invest in a cheap stabilization system, IS lenses, a tripod, or any of
the other ways of creating less shaky footage. They’re too inexpensive
to let shake stand in the way of otherwise great footage.</li>
</ol>

<p>Good luck!</p>

    <link href="http://jbuchbinder.com/2013/05/03/gear-vs-skill/"/>
    <updated>2013-05-03T18:10:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://jbuchbinder.com/2013/05/03/gear-vs-skill</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I remember a conversation I had with my brother, a few years back. He was
talking about the amount of photographic equipment which he had been dumping
money into purchasing, in the hopes of improving the output from his camera.
After months, if not years, of ordering and collecting equipment, he thought
that <em>one more thing</em> would make some difference. He then had an epiphany,
after viewing a photo of a sunset taken with a $12 disposable camera. The
full comment was:</p>

<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s even more impressive that such a sweet shot was taken with that cheapass Dakota. Every time I get the fool notion into my head that some new and expensive piece of equipment will make me a better photographer, I look at this picture and think, &#8220;ah, yes. Right.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>I’ve been thinking about this, as I acquire more cinematography gear. At
which point does it become less about the gear, and more about the wetware?
(Wetware, for those who are unaware, refers to your biological “meat
equipment”.)</p>

<p>I’m divided on this point. I do feel that there are certain limitations
inherent in not possessing the proper tool for the job. To put a concrete
example together: if you’re using a Canon EOS T2i, your image quality isn’t
going to be the same as using a much higher quality camera and sensor
(sticking to the DSLR for this point), but it’s theoretically possible to
clean up footage in post-production to <em>approach</em> the type of output which
you could achieve with a higher-grade sensor and optics. However, if you’re
using a standard kit lens on that camera (which probably tops out at an f/3.5
if you’re really, really lucky), you’re not going to be able to get the
narrow depth-of-field which is associated with most “cinematic” shots. A
<a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/consumer/products/cameras/ef_lens_lineup/ef_50mm_f_1_8_ii">Canon 50mm f/1.8 “plastic fantastic”</a> lens (on which I’ve seen far too many
budding cinematographers rely exclusively) is an interesting start, but can’t
completely replace a series of really wide open glass primes (sub-f/2.0).</p>

<p>The flip side of the coin is the point which my brother had made; if your
eye sucks, your footage sucks. A lot of the cinematographers (and just plain
old camera operators) with which I’ve come in contact have bemoaned not
owning a RED ONE, or even a higher grade DSLR camera body – and assuming
that any decent footage I can pull has everything to do with the equipment
I’m using, and nothing to do with my ability to use said equipment.</p>

<p>Years ago, I remember a gig I had, as a bass player. At the time, I had
brought a <a href="http://www.vintagewashburn.com/Bass/Mercurybass.html">Washburn MB-6</a> (a strange Mercury series instrument with
fantastic action, scored on eBay for very little money), and had finished
a really heart-felt set. Some jackass came up to me and complimented the
instrument.  I figured, from that point on, I would just assume that if
someone commented on my instrument, they were implicitly insulting me, by
implying that the instrument provided the quality which they admired, and
that anyone would have been able to do the same, given the chance to play
that instrument.</p>

<p>To sum up, you need a good eye – more than anything else – but it’s also
important to have the right equipment for the right purpose. Oh, and don’t
forget to stabilize your shots …</p>

It seems to integrate a little bit better with both my “command line ethos” and my workflow.

Please excuse the mess, we’re remodeling.</p>

<p>In addition to the move, I’m trying to move away from blog entries regarding political events – not because I should be worried about potential ramifications for my professional/public life – but rather because there’s only a certain amount of pissing into the wind that a man can do before he gets tired of having a mouthful of piss. That’s not to say that there won’t be <em>any</em> political stuff here, but there’s going to be far less.</p>

    <updated>2012-11-06T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://jbuchbinder.com/2012/11/06/election-2012-summary</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s the day before the 2012 Presidental Election. I’m disappointed, as usual, by the choice of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitt_Romney">far right</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama">center right</a> “choices” that we have. I again am forced into the decision of either voting for the preferable third party candidate, with whom I share views on the vast majority of issues (<a href="http://www.jillstein.org/">Dr. Jill Stein</a>, for anyone wondering — I still think Ron Paul is a complete crankcase, and Gary Johnson is way too “fuck Federalism” for my taste) and effectively helping to elect an out-of-touch sociopathic plutocrat butt-munch, or vote the “lesser of two evils” and probably end up with a Democrat who is going to “<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/obama-says-hell-renew-pursuit-of-grand-bargain-offering-specifics-on-agenda/2012/10/24/0e2b843c-1e0e-11e2-9cd5-b55c38388962_story.html">Grand Bargain</a>” away the Great Society programs. All of that being said, I have a few serious issues with this election cycle.</p>

<p><em>Throwing bullshit at the wall to see what sticks / low information idiots destroy America.</em> Don’t bother reading Politifact. Their attempt to be “non partisan” by rating the attempt to replace Medicare with a privatized program (effectively ending the program as we know it) as “half true” (and then upgrading to “<a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/03/barack-obama/obama-says-romney-wants-turn-medicare-voucher-prog/">mostly true</a>“, after rounds of pounding), simply because the word “voucher” was used to describe the festering husk of Medicare after it had been dessicated by years of crap like “Medicare Advantage” and Governor Rick Scott’s <a href="http://www.wusf.usf.edu/news/2010/06/18/whistleblowers_say_rick_scott_knew_about_medicare_fraud">side ventures into fraud</a>, then given out as coupons/vouchers to purchase overpriced and underregulated private insurance. You know, after “Obamacare is repealed” and the jackholes in the insurance industry can go back to fucking people in any way they see fit — government regulation and oversight is apparently for places like Europe, Canada — hell, anywhere but here. But I digress.</p>

<p>The whole idea that Romney had been running a campaign which has profited greatly by effectively lying about the other guy — wholesale, mind you, not the usual half-truths we see from Presidental campaigns in the United States — is pretty sickening. A friend who works in the Connecticut prison system recently mentioned that he was going to vote for Romney because “Obamacare is going to make me pay more for my health insurance; and I have to look out for myself”. Some jackasses at work told him this, and he believed it — even though it’s patently and demonstrably false. As I saw somewhere on the interwebs “Obama isn’t a brown skinned guy who gives out free healthcare and hates rich people — you’re thinking of Jesus.” People apparently will follow their rampant self-interest, Grover-Norquist-style, even if it means screwing the shit out of everyone else. Not cool, America, not cool.</p>

<p><em>Voting for a third party candidate isn’t going to change squat, even if they won.</em> I can’t stress this enough. Enough of the country lives in some weird mix of medieval England and the 1950s, and votes as a bloc for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Santorum">loudest, crassest bible-thumper</a> in any election cycle (think of Dubya, who shouldn’t have been able to win an election cycle against a warm jar of Russian piss, had the contest been set up that way). Look, we’re going to have tea-hadist, teanderthals, whatever you want to call them, in the House of Representatives and the Senate. Low information, Dunning-Kruger-Effect proving, “self made” government haters, who don’t believe in science, and sure as hell don’t believe in the government to which they have been elected. Nothing is going to go well that way — and it’s a pretty good indictment of why both direct and representative democracy do not function well in a country full of ill informed voters. Voters, to which “intellectualism” is an anathema to their way of life. I don’t want a President or Representative with whom I can drink a can of local alcoholic swill — I want someone who is smarter than I am; someone who is intellectually invested in leading. I want someone who actually gives a half a fuck about *everyone*, not just the guys with money or the guys who are the loudest at the moment. A Green Party president, however nice, is only one leg of the trifecta of United States government. They might be able to stop some wars, and perhaps appoint less awful corporatists to the Supreme Court — but they don’t make the laws around here. Educate, educate, educate — that’s the only way out of this shit-hole. (Also, don’t even think about “Charter Schools”. They’re not only *not* a panacea, but by effectively removing the top tier of students and privatizing education, we’re removing the only trappings of equality which the lower end of the socioeconomic chain has…)</p>

<p><em>Voter disenfranchisement under the guise of “voter fraud”.</em> I don’t even need to really go into this, since so many other people have done it so well. I’ll lazy link to <a href="http://bobcesca.com/blog-archives/2012/11/six-hour-lines-and-voter-suppression-in-florida-and-ohio.html">Bob Cesca</a>, the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/voter-suppression-america">ACLU</a>, <a href="http://www.salon.com/2012/10/25/how_gop_voter_suppression_could_win_florida_and_the_white_house_for_romney/">Salon</a>, and <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/11/timeline-history-voter-suppression">Mother Jones</a>. I would find something a bit more right-leaning, but they’re still bitching about a statistically irrelevant excuse for disenfranchising <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-250_162-57511312/study-voter-id-law-would-exclude-up-to-700000-young-minorities/">primarily minority voters</a> — which apparently <a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/video-republicans-caught-committing-voter-fraud-only-registering-romney-voters">those same asshats have been perpetrating</a>. Stay classy, conservatives.</p>

<p><em>Military industrial complex leg-humping time.</em> We need to find out who is going to <a href="http://www.iraqbodycount.org/">bomb more dark people into pits in the sand</a>, and fast! Candidates are now trying to <a href="http://www.tonysrants.com/military/breaking-five-hundred-generals-and-admirals-endorse-mitt-romney/">rack up military endorsements</a> as fast as they can. This does not bode well for not killing people unnecessarily, as you can probably guess. I mean, when you frame the “debate” (which there really isn’t, at this point) as “keeping us safe”, you already know what the outcome is going to be, since both major political parties are completely in the tank for <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2010/mar/28/opinion/la-oe-hayden28-2010mar28">The Long War</a>. We haven’t been attacked by another country since Pearl Harbor, guys. And, in case you didn’t notice, the terrorists who flew planes into our buildings did so primarily because <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motives_for_the_September_11_attacks">we’ve been dicking with their countries for years</a>. Noam Chomsky got his <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/fighting_words/2011/05/chomskys_follies.html">ass chewed out by Chris Hitchens</a> for saying just that (not that I agree with Chris Hitchens’s views on the Iraq War, it’s just interesting that he thought it worthy of a piece in Slate). Honestly, I think Chomsky is a bit more knowledgeable and trustworthy on the subject than Hitchens — but again, I digress.</p>

<p><em>Trying to discredit math.</em> I wish I were kidding about this, since it is vaguely reminiscent of the same anti-intellectualism sentiment portrayed by Dick Nixon, and shows that the vast majority of people like to live in some sort of weird bubble. You know, the kind where “you’re for us, or you’re a fucking idiot”. Nate Silver, who has been <a href="http://www.advocate.com/politics/media/2012/10/28/nate-silver-laughs-accusation-he-too-effeminate-analyze-polls">vilified by Romney bootlickers for giving the answers straight from the math</a> demonstrates the bizarre “bubble world” that the GOP candidate has around him, reminiscent of the same “information bubble” of the less-than-venerable George W Bush.</p>

<p><em>Redefining what it means to be a “businessman”.</em> Have you ever seen the movie “<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102609/">Other People’s Money</a>“? Take away the empathy and life lessons learned, and you’ve got Willard Romney. “Leveraged buyouts”, especially when accomplished with a few million dollars of seed capital from your old man, have squat to do with the Conservative ideal of the job creator wunderkind. Seriously. Leveraged buyouts involve using other people’s money to purchase a controlling instance in a functional company, and saddle it with the burden of paying not only the original capital for its own takeover back, but also sucking the marrow of the company out to pay yourself a hefty sum for the pleasure of having downsized and screwed the hell out of that same company. It may be business (vulture capitalism at its very “best”), but it’s certainly not “business experience” in any relevant context to a nation’s economy, assuming that you were willing to accept the framing that a government should be run like a business, which it shouldn’t. (Quick rundown of that logic: Business’s primary motive is profit, whereas governments have to serve the populace without regard to financial status or profit. Governments also print their own money. It’s not the same thing, guys. It’s like saying that you can be the best train conductor *evar* because you have a driver’s license or learner’s permit.)</p>

<p><em>Rampant self-interest trumping rational societal decisions.</em> Norquist proved this years ago in California; people simply will not vote for things that cost them money, even if it makes society better and enriches the country. I’m not sure if this is a “Boomer generation” thing, or if we’re just turning into selfish, ignorant, navel-gazing fuckwads through cultural inundation. I’ve seen people use the specter of “tax increases” as a reason for voting the GOP party line, even when those supposed “tax increases” aren’t born out by reality. Jeez, if you get your news from a crazy idiot like Glenn Beck (theblaze.com, anyone?), do you really think it’s going to somehow shape your decisions in some sort of informed and non-navel-gazing context? </p>

<p>I’ll end this with a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efKguI0NFek">George Carlin quote</a>: “If you’ve got selfish, ignorant citizens, you’re going to get selfish ignorant leaders.” I don’t think I could have said it better, George.</p>
