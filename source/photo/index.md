Welcome to my digital photography page!

![][1]

I have been taking pictures for years, but have only recently (as in the last few years) gotten into the digital photography racket.

Here are the cameras that I have been using:

*   Casio QV 5000SX – God-awful battery life; needed an external battery pack.
*   Olympus D-320L – Used this one only for a brief time. Worked pretty well.
*   [Ritz PureDigital Disposable Camera][2] – It’s not the best quality, but the price was excellent, and it has been very durable, lasting through a lot of abuse.
*   Samsung Digimax 200
*   [Canon EOS Digital Rebel XT (350D)][3] – Primary camera for almost two years. Tasha now uses it most of the time.
*   [Canon EOS 40D][4] – I got this in early 2008 as an “upgrade” to the 350D. Great camera.
*   [Canon EOS 5D mark III][5] – My current primary camera.

As for lenses for the Canon EOS bodies, my current collection includes:

*   **“Ye Olde Kit Lense”**. This thing came with it. It’s a fine lens, 18-55mm, I believe.
*   **Tamron 75-300mm lens**. Great third party lens for far away shots. I don’t use this as much anymore since I got the IS lens.
*   **Vivitar 135mm fixed focal length lens** It’s a Nikon-mount lens attached to a 5$ chinese adapter ring. It takes fantastic black and white shots, and is my favorite piece-of-crap 7$ lens.
*   **Soliger 135mm lens with 2x teleconverter**. I’m not really that fond of this lens. It’s a Pentax screw-mount lens, also attached to a 5$ chinese adapter ring. The teleconverter is okay, but this lens combination has mostly been phased out in favor of the Tamron. Especially since I think it’s a bit wobbly.
*   **Canon 50mm f/1.8**. Great portrait lens. Also known as the "plastic fantastic", among cheap lens afficionados.
*   **Canon EF 28-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USM**. Came with the 40D, and is now my primary lens.
*   **[Canon EF 70-200mm f/2.8 L IS USM II][8]**
*   **Rokinon 85mm f/1.4**. Upon reflection, I would rather have bought the de-clicked f/1.5 cine version of this, but it's a really great, really bright lens.

I’m sure there are others, but I can’t think of them right now…

Some of the places my photos have appeared include:

*   [This picture of Gordon Bok][6] appeared in Maine’s “Village Soup” magazine for a [retrospective on Gordon Bok][7].
*   [This picture of Isabella]() was chosen for a “dog of the day” website. Can’t remember where.
