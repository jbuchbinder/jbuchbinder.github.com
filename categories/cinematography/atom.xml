    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There&rsquo;s only a slight difference in the textbook definition between a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinematographer">cinematographer</a> and a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_operator">camera operator</a>. Besides the
slight variance in responsibilities (a cinematographer/DP can be responsible
for several camera operators), there are some additional skills and
aptitudes which play into the decision to try to be a cinematographer.</p>

<p>None of this is meant to downplay the skill and experience which make a
great camera operator. Knowing your equipment, being able to choose the
proper lenses and camera settings, being able to operate that equipment,
being able to interpret the direction of both the director and the
cinematographer, and being able to hold together a cohesive shot &mdash;
these are all the hallmarks of a great camera operator.</p>

<p>At a much, much more basic level, there&rsquo;s an <em>art</em> to cinematography, which
transcends the physical manipulations of the equipment involved, and becomes
more about creating a sort of separate reality; that of capturing a little
slice of time and space, motion and stillness, light and dark, vibrant
colors and subtle undertones. That&rsquo;s the part of this that, to me, offers
the most promising creativity and the most fulfilling, yet burdening, tasks.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s very easy to get lost in the minutiae of camera settings adjustments,
equipment acquisition, troubleshooting and stabilization, among other
demons &mdash; but the <em>art</em> is the derivative of those functions.</p>

<p>To properly illustrate this, I think of a concert I attended, quite a few
years ago. The guitarist, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/VernonReid">Vernon Reid</a>,
was (and still is), an amazing technical instrumentalist. I watched him dance
over the semi-circle of effects pedals and boxes, his hands moving,
seemingly effortlessly over the six strings on his instrument. It struck me
as astounding. We are all, in some way, capable of recognizing genius and
immense skill, even if we cannot reproduce it, or explain it in purely
quantifiable terms. In that way, the body of his technical skills simply
became a foundation for the <em>art</em> which was made by way of them. I wish I
could explain it better &mdash; I only know that I could recognize it when I saw
it. The man himself, whom I had the pleasure of speaking with for a few
brief moments, was very humble and very &ldquo;zen&rdquo; about his skill and his art.</p>

<p>Due to my particular circumstances, I&rsquo;ve been able to pick and choose projects,
more of late, specifically based on their relative merits to me. As such, I
haven&rsquo;t had much experience acting strictly as a &ldquo;camera operator&rdquo;. There
may be some hubris, on my part, which would have come out of getting to
perform the artistic duties of a cinematographer on the vast majority of the
projects on which I&rsquo;ve been involved. It has given me an affinity for the
creative aspects of the job. For as long as I&rsquo;ve been involved with
cinematography, I have always assumed that being a &ldquo;camera operator&rdquo; has been
a step towards being a cinematographer; a way of honing the technical
foundation of the craft, so that the art can come later. It seemed like an
&ldquo;apprenticeship&rdquo;, much as the old focus pullers became second unit
cameramen, to eventually move up to first units, then perhaps aspire to
become a cinematographer one day&hellip;</p>

<p>The landscape, mostly due to the explosion of low-cost cinematography
(fueled primarily by DSLR cinematography), has been shifting away from that
old model. Most projects have one, perhaps two camera operators &mdash; and the
primary camera operator is usually the cinematographer/DP. Many projects
don&rsquo;t even <em>have</em> a second camera operator &mdash; it simply isn&rsquo;t required.</p>

<p>Ultimately, it depends what your plans and/or revenue model is.</p>

<ul>
<li>If you want to learn more about how to get your equipment to perform
the way you want it to perform, you may do well working as a camera
operator with a seasoned cinematographer, rather than holding out for
a DP position on a project.</li>
<li>If you want to make a living behind a camera, you can&rsquo;t really differentiate
between cinematography and camera operator work &mdash; at least as long as
you want to keep a steady revenue stream up. Even the best cinematographers
can moonlight as strict &ldquo;camera operators&rdquo; when the pay is right.</li>
<li>If you want to work in a lower pressure environment, you might want to
be a camera operator. Cinematographers are responsible for everything
visual which goes on in a project, and it can be a lot of stress.</li>
<li>If you feel passionate enough about a project to want to be involved at
any cost, you might sign on as a camera operator.</li>
</ul>


<p>Even though there&rsquo;s a lot of competition for certain spots on certain
projects, we&rsquo;re all on the same team; we all (for the most part) are
interested in shooting great footage, and many of us are concerned about
creating enduring works of art, wherever possible. We all have great
potential for growth, so whatever your career and job choice, good luck!</p>

    <link href="http://jbuchbinder.com/2013/09/10/prime-lenses-and-proper-depth-of-field/"/>
    <updated>2013-09-10T13:24:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://jbuchbinder.com/2013/09/10/prime-lenses-and-proper-depth-of-field</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Depth of field is a massively misunderstood &ldquo;side effect&rdquo; of iris size, and
an ultimately useful storytelling tool (when used properly).</p>

<p>DSLR photography has spawned a large group of cinematographers who are
dealing with largely light-insensitive camera sensors (usually producing
fairly unacceptable noise when used at greater sensitivies than ISO 800).
This has created a need for &ldquo;fast&rdquo; lenses, which are lenses which have very
large maximum apertures, featuring maximum f-stop ratings like f/2.0, f/1.8,
and even f/1.4 (there are even some <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/news/2013/08/06/kubrick-s-f-0-7-lenses-now-available-for-rent-but-start-saving-up">f/0.7 lenses</a> out there, but I&rsquo;m
sticking to the realm of affordable DSLR cinematography, at the moment).
Using firmware like <a href="http://magiclantern.fm/">Magic Lantern</a> allows us to use
focus peaking to exploit manual-focus and non-EF mount lenses (for those
Canon-philes among us), to bring down the effective cost of shooting &ldquo;fast&rdquo;
lenses. I have some M42 &ldquo;Pentax screw-mount&rdquo; lenses which open to f/2.8 &mdash;
acquired for less than 10 USD each, plus a 7 USD <a href="http://amzn.to/1fVPGyf">M42-to-EF adapter ring</a>.
If you&rsquo;re interested in more information on how to use focus peaking, check
out <a href="http://fstoppers.com/using-magic-lantern-with-focus-peaking-for-free-lensing">how it works</a>.</p>

<p>So, you&rsquo;ve beaten high-cost DSLR and cinema camera body manufacturers by
using &ldquo;fast&rdquo; lenses, right? Well, not so fast, there&hellip; You have to consider
the <em>side effect</em> of fast lenses and wide apertures: the shallow depth of
field. It&rsquo;s both a blessing and a curse; we tend to associate shallow depth
of field images and video with expensive equipment (rightfully so, in most
cases) and a more personal type of image, but those lenses are not
universally usable &ldquo;wide open&rdquo;. Many shots come off looking amateurish and
ill-composed, when half of the subjects are out of focus, because they&rsquo;ve
exceeded the edges of the &ldquo;sharp&rdquo; area in the focus range.</p>

<p>(There&rsquo;s also lack of lens sharpness and chromatic abberation to consider,
which are generally present, to some degree, in the widest aperture settings
available on most lenses. That&rsquo;s a very intensely technical discussion,
however, and will probably be reserved for a future posting.)</p>

<p>When considering the depth of field you want, consider the subject (or
literal <em>focus</em>) of the shot, and figure out how much of the shot needs to
be in focus to properly tell your story. The depth of field is very
important for exposing the mise-en-scène in the way which best represents
both the explicit visuals and external representation of internal
character development and exposition. If your character needs to &ldquo;pop&rdquo;
out of the scenery, a narrow DOF would be perfect &mdash; but if they are to
appear as a figurative cog in the machinery of the world, you&rsquo;re probably
going to be looking for the widest DOF (approaching infinity) as you can
get. When widening the DOF like this, you&rsquo;ll most likely have to compensate
by boosting the ambient lighting, or adding additional lighting, to
adjust for the decreased light hitting your camera sensor.</p>

<p>There are a number of tools for figuring out the proper DOF for a certain
shot, based on the camera/sensor, lens focal length, and distance to
primary focal point.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.dofmaster.com/dofjs.html">Web-based DOF calculator</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.dofmaster.com/android.html">Android calculator</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.dofmaster.com/iphone.html">iOS calculator</a></li>
</ul>


<p>There are more of them, but if you specify the variables, you can adjust
the aperture f-stop to the widest setting which properly fits the scene
and visuals which you&rsquo;re attempting to achieve.</p>

<p>Like anything else, this isn&rsquo;t strictly an instructional A-to-B guide on
how to achieve stunning visuals; it&rsquo;s simply an attempt to share some of
what I&rsquo;ve learned, and to help share the knowledge and tools to exploit
your own inner artistic vision. Good luck shooting!</p>

    <link href="http://jbuchbinder.com/2013/09/07/to-post-or-not-to-post/"/>
    <updated>2013-09-07T13:18:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://jbuchbinder.com/2013/09/07/to-post-or-not-to-post</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Even though a good portion of the work has been completed when you press the
shutter button, or stop rolling, since all of your planning and execution has
been completed, there&rsquo;s still a final step (or series of steps) to bring that
artistic effort to a presentable format.</p>

<p>Many people shoot with default (or very close to default) settings on their
camera or videocamera, and do simple &ldquo;post production&rdquo; by simply cropping or
cutting whatever comes out of their camera body. This is a very &ldquo;purist&rdquo; way
of going about shooting, but can also rob your end product of some of the
polish and slight adjustments which can take good pictures or footage and
make them into something extraordinary.</p>

<p>All of that being said, there&rsquo;s a limit to the types and amounts of post
production which can and should be used, much in the way that overproducing
a musical album can result in a homogenous and lifeless product, robbed of
the &ldquo;soul&rdquo; and variances which make it unique. You are the only person who
can decide how much, if any, post processing is right for your project or
other artistic endeavor.</p>

<p><strong>RAW versus JPEG/H.264</strong></p>

<p>With DSLR cameras being used for both photography and cinematography, there
are places where the &ldquo;processing&rdquo; aspect can be pushed off into the post
production process.</p>

<p>For photography, RAW format pictures can allow recovery past some of the
previously accepted limits of what would normally be considered lost or
unusable. Effectively, it allows you to make the decisions which are
normally pushed off on your camera&rsquo;s processor (the DIGIC processor(s),
for all of you Canon users). It adds an additional step to the
post-processing workflow, in that you&rsquo;ll need a piece of software like
<a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom.html">Adobe Lightroom</a> for Windows/Mac users, or if you&rsquo;re a Linux user like me,
<a href="http://rawstudio.org/">Raw Studio</a>. It also adds a significant amount of time to the
photographic post-processing workflow, in that there are a number of
additional parameters which can be adjusted, which would normally result
in image degradation, but can be adjusted in RAW images with little or no
deleterious effect. If you&rsquo;re a <a href="http://www.magiclantern.fm/">Magic Lantern</a> user, you can also
experiment with &ldquo;dual ISO&rdquo; images, which can create images with enormous
dynamic range through sensor tricks &mdash; but which adds an another step
before RAW processing, that of running a CR2HDR binary. (If you&rsquo;re
interested in trying this out, but don&rsquo;t want to compile a CR2HDR binary
for Windows or Linux, I have binaries available <a href="https://bitbucket.org/rufustfirefly/magic-lantern/downloads">here</a>)</p>

<p>For cinematography, there&rsquo;s a lot more to think about. Magic Lantern users
of Canon 5Dmk3 models (and some others, as well) have the option of being
able to shoot RAW video with some very fast CF cards. This adds a pretty
substantial amount of post-processing steps <em>before</em> your NLE (non-linear
editor) of choice enters the picture. There are a pretty wide swath of
applications which now support the Magic Lantern RAW format, including
<a href="http://www.magiclantern.fm/forum/index.php?action=printpage;topic=5557.0">RAWanizer</a>, but your best bet is to get involved with the Magic
Lantern forum if you want to begin working with a RAW workflow. The other
serious disadvantage is storage space. Standard H.264 video, which is
shot by most DSLR camera bodies, has issues with some digital artifacts in
certain scenarios, as well as some dynamic range issues (some of which can
be made better by use of flat color profiles like <a href="https://www.technicolorcinestyle.com/download/">Cinestyle</a>, but I&rsquo;ll
leave that for later) &mdash; but it produces fairly compact files, even at
1080p/24p (1920x1080 24fps progressive) resolution. RAW data can take
upwards of a gigabyte of space every 15-20 seconds. Your storage media
and backup solutions have to be able to deal with that, so it&rsquo;s something
to seriously consider before deciding to move a project to work with that
format.</p>

<p><strong>White Balance</strong></p>

<p>It used to be accepted that white balancing (determining where &ldquo;true white&rdquo;
lies in an image, compensating for varying light color temperatures) had to
be done &ldquo;in camera&rdquo;, before shots were taken. There are a number of tools
which allow this to be done in post-processing.</p>

<p>Photographers can do this when shooting with RAW camera images very
simply, as most RAW image processors have a simple white balancing tool. It&rsquo;s
still possible to do this with processed JPEG images, but with the
potential for losing some image data. Depending on how comfortable you are
with straying from the &ldquo;truest possible image&rdquo;, you can decide where you
feel comfortable dealing with white balancing.</p>

<p>Cinematographers have a pretty vast array of white balancing and color
correction plugins available for their NLE of choice. I&rsquo;m most familiar with
Adobe Premiere, so I&rsquo;d mention <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/VideoRoad/2010/05/using_the_fast_color_corrector.html">Fast Color Corrector</a> and
<a href="http://philipbloom.net/forum/threads/tutorial-color-grading-and-styling-with-colorista-ii.2528/">Red Giant Colorista II</a>, both of which offer pretty decent white
balancing capabilities, among other things. If you&rsquo;re concerned about
render speed, Fast Color Corrector seems to win out against Colorista II,
but Colorista II has some additional parameters and capabilities which
far outstrip what FCC has to offer. There&rsquo;s also software like
<a href="http://tv.adobe.com/watch/learn-premiere-pro-cc/color-grading-premiere-pro-sequences-in-speedgrade/">Adobe Speedgrade</a> and <a href="http://digitalfilms.wordpress.com/2013/02/02/davinci-resolve-workflows/">Blackmagic Design Davinci Resolve</a>, both
of which offer white balancing, color correction, and color grading
capabilities. There are a few threads <a href="http://forums.planet5d.com/threads/123505-Adobe-Speedgrade-vs-DaVinci-Resolve">comparing the two of them</a>.</p>

<p>The important distinction is whether or not you want to spend the time
to properly white balance your images or footage before you take pictures.
It&rsquo;s not always condusive to your shooting workflow to do so, and if this
is a factor, you should seriously consider some of the post-processing
options. It&rsquo;s obviously to your greatest advantage to have the most
accurate input images/footage to bring into your post-processing
workflow, but sometimes it&rsquo;s not pragmatic to take a completely purist
attitude in this regard.</p>

<p><strong>Exposure</strong></p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve all been bitten by changing light conditions, unexpected events, or
incorrect metering producing images or footage which has exposure problems.
If you&rsquo;re shooting RAW (or using Magic Lantern&rsquo;s Dual ISO hack), this is
an ideal place to examine using post-processing to correct these issues.</p>

<p>We would all like to properly expose everything (unless we have a
particular artistic reason for doing otherwise, since in the art of
photography or cinematography, there are generally exceptions to every
rule, rules were made to be broken, etc), but taking a post-processing
detour to correct such things is generally preferable to re-arranging a
shoot.</p>

<p><strong>Special Effects</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not a big fan of post-processing special effects, mainly because I
am a proponent of the idea that it takes some of the artistry out of
pulling off those same effects &ldquo;in camera&rdquo;. I do understand that there
are certain effects which would be either very difficult or downright
impossible to achieve without the use of computer generated effects &mdash;
but there&rsquo;s a lot of things which can be accomplished <em>without</em> that.</p>

<p>Lighting is something which I&rsquo;ve seen done in post, which generally
baffles me. It&rsquo;s something which is pretty simple to execute properly,
given a little time and effort. Saving images or footage with issues
might be a good use for that, but it&rsquo;s probably not something I would
recommend doing for everyday editing and processing.</p>

<p>For example, having someone &ldquo;eaten&rdquo; by light can be accomplished for
a cinematographer, simply by adjusting the fill light to blow out the
whites, then opening the iris of the lens (using a focus pulling kit,
or just a spare hand, for the less equipment-heavy among us) to allow
the fill light to &ldquo;eat&rdquo; the remainder of the image. That can be done
without any specific post-processing.</p>

<p><strong>Flat Color Profiles</strong></p>

<p>This is pretty much for cinematographers, since photographers could
simply take RAW photos &mdash; and cinematographers shooting RAW should
probably ignore this section, as well.</p>

<p>There are quite a few &ldquo;flat color profiles&rdquo; available for DSLR
(and other) bodies, such as the aforementioned Technicolor Cinestyle
profile and the <a href="http://www.similaar.com/foto/flaat-picture-styles/long-1.html">Flaat Picture Style</a>. These work by effectively
increasing the dynamic range being captured by the camera by storing
the values differently than the stock picture profile.</p>

<p>I highly recommend shooting with one, if you&rsquo;re not going to make the
leap to shoot RAW. It does add the additional step in post-processing
of having to adjust the blacks/whites and/or applying a corrective
LUT (look up table) to adjust the end product to look less &ldquo;washed
out&rdquo;. There are LUTs and plugins available for virtually every NLE
out there right now &mdash; and I suggest learning how to do this. The
improvement in the end product is substantial for relatively little
time investment.</p>

<p><strong>Audio Post</strong></p>

<p>This is another section just for cinematographers.</p>

<p>The audio which is recorded with footage is generally &ldquo;reference
audio&rdquo;, which is meant to be replaced by actual audio, generally
recorded with something like a <a href="http://tascam.com/product/dr-40/">Tascam DR-40</a> or <a href="http://www.zoom.co.jp/english/products/h4n/">Zoom H4n</a>
external recorder and a shotgun microphone. It&rsquo;s far outside the
scope of this to explain the majority of these technologies and
techniques, but sufficed to say that they produce far cleaner and
usable recordings than on-camera audio (even when using augmented
on-camera microphones, etc). If you can afford it, use external
audio, and have an experienced audio engineer perform some basic
post-production on your audio.</p>

<p>If you can&rsquo;t afford it, or don&rsquo;t have an audio engineer, there are
a few basic steps to get cleaner audio.</p>

<p>1) <em>Don&rsquo;t use the microphone built into the camera</em>. It sounds pretty
awful, and is noisy. Get a lav microphone for interviews, or a
directional hot-shoe mounted external microphone for anything else.</p>

<p>2) <em>Adjust the audio levels manually</em>. Automatic level adjustment is
going to be terrible. It&rsquo;s meant to avoid clipping, but it tends to
make the noise floor (the level of background noise) jump around as
the camera readjusts the audio recording level, so it may make your
life significantly more difficult when it comes time to adjust the
footage later. Adjust it to the loudest sound you&rsquo;re going to be
recording &mdash; then perhaps a click lower, for safety.</p>

<p>3) <em>Respect the inverse square law</em>. For those unfamiliar, sounds
drop at a logarithmic rate as you move away from the sound source,
following the same inverse square law which is used to figure light
source brightness. The closer you are to a recorded sounds, the
cleaner and better the source audio will be. Every object which a
sound hits will produce a &ldquo;reflection&rdquo; (much as light does). If that
reflection is equal or louder than the volume of the source sound,
you&rsquo;re going to get a pretty terrible sounding audio recording.</p>

<p>4) <em>Get the cleanest audio possible</em>. Try to cut down on external
noise sources. Never assume that you can clean something later on;
you should be trying to get clean audio. If something has to be
re-taken to avoid a lawnmower being run in the background, then you
should seriously consider doing it. It&rsquo;ll save you from pulling out
your hair.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure that this isn&rsquo;t a <em>comprehensive</em> list, but hopefully this
will help everyone get started with deciding what, if anything, to
relegate to their post-processing workflow. Good luck!</p>

    <updated>2013-06-28T15:40:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://jbuchbinder.com/2013/06/28/skill-in-the-age-of-instagram</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I had started a post a few months ago, which I had tentatively titled &ldquo;Approximating Skill&rdquo;. It was a fairly scathing indictment of what I had refered to as the &ldquo;Instagram generation&rdquo;.</p>

<p>As anyone who has been following my recent posts here knows, I attach a lot of importance to the notion of &ldquo;skill&rdquo;, especially in relation to art forms where there are popular misconceptions regarding the ability to &ldquo;buy&rdquo; your way into a particular skill-set.</p>

<p>In &ldquo;<a href="/2013/05/03/gear-vs-skill/">Skill vs Gear</a>&rdquo;, I had tried to explain that, no matter how many toys or additional pieces were added into any mix, the most important variable is the skill of the operator/artist in control of the production. It seems like a fairly simple thing to understand, but in the muddied world of extensive post-production and devalued skill-sets, that common understanding is constantly called into question.</p>

<p>Take <a href="http://instagram.com/">Instagram</a>, for example. It&rsquo;s a fairly simple concept, being a marriage between Twitter-style <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign">hashtags</a> (don&rsquo;t get me started on that &mdash; we should just call it U+0023 and get it over with), social networking, and cameraphone photography. (I happen to particularly loathe cameraphone photography, except for the ubiquitous and universally available nature of cameraphones.) The issues, as far as I&rsquo;m concerned, begin to arise in the dual areas of devaluation and lack of appreciation.</p>

<p><strong>Devaluation</strong>. This comes into play when every Instagram (or insert other type of skill-sapping or replacing app here) user begins to assume that they, yes they, are capable of producing professional results. Malcolm Gladwell famously claimed that it took <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book)">10,000 hours</a> of time to amass enough skill to master a certain skill-set. I prefer to refer to <a href="http://enticingthelight.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Stages-of-a-Photographer.png">this chart</a> (ignore some of the strange and inappropriate labels &mdash; the sentiment is the important part). As perceived self-skill increases, valuation of others' skill-sets decreases. This explains much of the reluctance to hire professional photographers and cinematographers/videographers, or to value their skills so little that an insulting amount of compensation is considered &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; for their time and effort.</p>

<p><strong>Lack of appreciation</strong>. Autotune and Instagram are both partially to blame for this &mdash; but it seems as though actual skill is barely recognizable anymore, to a vast swath of the population, for any given skill-set. I do understand that the <a href="http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Dunning-Kruger_effect">Dunning-Kruger Effect</a> means that any person is going to assess their own skill-set incorrectly. This, however, reaches far beyond that conclusion. After having been subjected to hundreds, if not thousands, of hours of blown out and ill-colored photos, and subjected to far too many songs which have been pitch corrected beyond human recognition, the latest generation has mostly lost the ability to differentiate between &ldquo;faked&rdquo; output and true skill. I recently had an entire photoshoot (which I dutifully handed over to the photographed party) blown out, miscolored, and made to look like a bunch of terrible Instagram photos &mdash; all, supposedly, in the name of appealing to the younger generation, as they &ldquo;appreciate&rdquo; things that look like that. As far as faked output goes, it&rsquo;s not limited to amateurs; big budget Hollywood studios have been <a href="http://www.cracked.com/article_18664_5-annoying-trends-that-make-every-movie-look-same.html">exploiting basic digital correction</a> to make everything look the same &mdash; the Instagramification of movies (that article also points out the annoying &ldquo;shaky cam&rdquo; stuff that I had been discussing in my <a href="/2013/06/03/stabilization/">earlier post</a>). In the end, skills fall along the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">standard/normal distribution curve</a>, even if the skills represented by the vertical axis may be logarithmic in scale.</p>

<p><strong>The Hipster Effect</strong>. I realize that I only counted two areas earlier in this post, but this would lack something if I didn&rsquo;t mention the effect that the &ldquo;Hipster&rdquo; culture has had on perceived skills. Rather than reiterate every terrible think about Hipster culture, <a href="http://www.wolfgnards.com/index.php/2010/08/27/the-irony-of-the-ironic-hipsters-don-t-understand-irony">I&rsquo;ll let this guy do it for me</a>. I don&rsquo;t know if I can explain this better than <strong>there is no such thing as ironically bad music or photography</strong>. The misconception that there is has very deeply damaged the ability for the average hipster to properly appreciate music and photography, assuming that they are searching for ironically bad things, rather than attempting to appreciate skill. Crummy audio recordings, &ldquo;vintage looks&rdquo;, and other gimmicks serve to hide, rather than accentuate, the skills involved in the production of the underlying art.</p>

<p><strong>Processing/Post-Production</strong>. When you do not require initial skill to create something, but can merely &ldquo;<a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/this-looks-shopped">shop</a>&rdquo; your way out of any situation, the underlying skill is devalued, and sometimes forgotten. I&rsquo;ve been trying to emphasize the value of learning to create effects and the vast majority of the cinematic treatment of the mise-en-scène, rather than simply using a series of post-production tools to bend the footage to my will. This has more to do with the propensity for forgetting basic cinematic technique which comes with foregoing the steps involved with figuring out how to do this work on set. The real damnation seems to come when there is <em>no actual knowledge</em> of the underpinnings and workings of the art, and a novice decides to use post-processing <em>exclusive of skill</em>. This is the disease which is Instagram, Autotune, and Photoshop, in a nutshell.</p>

<p>The only way to fight this is to not concede defeat. If we are actually artists instead of simple camera jockeys, why shouldn&rsquo;t we be pushing for our craft and skill-set to receive the recognition which it deserves? I understand that some of the lost ground, in terms of general appreciation, has been lost &mdash; but hopefully we can keep the situation from getting much worse through education and perserverence.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>DSLR cinematography (the practice of cinematography using relatively inexpensive DSLR camera bodies, which were originally purposed for still photography) has been enjoying a sort of minature renaissance over the last few years.</p>

<p>I was pleasantly surprised to find out that Shane Carruth&rsquo;s new movie, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2084989/">Upstream Color</a>, was shot entirely on a DSLR body. The information I&rsquo;ve been reading indicates that he used a Panasonic GH2 DSLR body, with a few lenses, including the <a href="http://slrgear.com/reviews/showproduct.php/product/1577/cat/110">Rokinon 85mm f/1.4</a> (which I highly recommend). It scored at Sundance, and if it hadn&rsquo;t been for a few &ldquo;behind the scenes&rdquo; photos, it might not have been quite that apparent.</p>

<p>Of course, Carruth also ended up using some <a href="http://www.kenrockwell.com/voigtlander/">Voigtlander</a> glass, which is by no stretch of the imagination cheap/affordable for cash-strapped indie filmmakers. There&rsquo;s an interesting write-up on the whole thing <a href="http://www.eoshd.com/content/10309/gh2-shot-sci-fi-upstream-color-breaks-300000-mark-at-the-us-box-office">at EOSHD</a>.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a reason why I bring up &ldquo;Upstream Color&rdquo; &mdash; and it&rsquo;s a point that I&rsquo;ve been trying to make, off and on, for the past year or so. That film grossed over 300k dollars at the box office, and was shot on a small, inexpensive camera body. Still, it produced stunning visuals and did not seem to suffer from most of the &ldquo;fatal flaws&rdquo; that most seem to ascribe to DSLR cinematography, in general. The point, boiled down to its most essential component, is that the most important piece of equipment you&rsquo;ve got is between your forehead and your nose. You can&rsquo;t buy your way into it, and you can&rsquo;t just assume that if you own it, you can shoot as well as cinematographer X who has the current successful movie on the big screen.</p>

<p>Whether or not you&rsquo;re a big fan of &ldquo;Act of Valor&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Fast and Furious&rdquo; franchise, you can still appreciate Shane Hurlbut&rsquo;s <a href="http://blog.planet5d.com/2012/02/act-of-valor-leap-of-faith/">extensive use of Canon EOS 5D mk III bodies</a>. He has had a series of posts on his blog praising not only the relative inexpensive nature of the 5D bodies, but also their versatility.</p>

<p>For every person who says &ldquo;I shoot on the RED ONE&rdquo; and produces sub-standard output, or bemoans not being able to afford an ARRI which would &ldquo;really make a beautiful movie&rdquo; &mdash; I call foul on that entire argument. Even contending with a more limited dynamic range (a common DSLR problem), a top resolution of 1080p for shooting, and mostly commodity lenses, Carruth managed to produce something beautiful. It&rsquo;s not down to the equipment you buy, folks, it&rsquo;s how you use it.</p>

<p>Good luck.</p>
