> *Without music life would be a mistake. – Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche*

Music is an integral part of my life. Here’s some information on things that I’m involved in musically.

*   [evoke][1] – Hard rock trio with me on bass.
*   [JohnFest][2] – Recordings and media from John Mayer’s summer music get-together. Unofficial, of course, but the event doesn’t really have a website other than this.
*   [Open Mic at the Stonewall Tavern][3] – Pictures and recordings of the Tuesday open mic at the Stonewall Tavern in Eagleville, CT. The Stonewall Tavern does have its own myspace page at . There is also a myspace page specifically for the Open Mic which I put up to point the the appropriate places, at .
*   [The Studio][4] – All of the studio-related stuff is over here
