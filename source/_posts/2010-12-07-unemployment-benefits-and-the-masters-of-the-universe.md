The [Masters of the Universe][1] seem to have a vested interest in the [death of 99 week unemployment benefits][2], which I’m just starting to realize.

There is a pretty substantial [inverse relationship between the DJIA and unemployment rates][3]. By “unemployment rates”, we’re not talking about the [Bureau of Labor Statistics][4] U-6 numbers, indicating our entire workforce, but rather the more limited U-3 numbers, which indicate “Total unemployed, as a percent of the civilian labor force”. Let’s face it, it’s in the best interest of the ruling parties to [keep the official unemployment rate low][5], to boost perception.

Shit, if I were to take a quick look at [the DOL page][6] on unemployment, it paints a bleaker picture than the [rally in the DJIA][7] which Bloomberg reports is tied to an “increase in job openings”. (Their “live ticker” for official unemployment numbers is [here][8].)

What does this have to do with the “Masters of the Universe”? They’re going to be making a \*killing\* in the order of billions of dollars as stock prices predictably rise, of course. Doesn’t matter that we [are losing manufacturing jobs][9] due to globalization efforts and increased mechanization, or that [stagnant wages][10] and [rising income disparity][11] means you’ll die poorer and your upward mobility in terms of income is, for all intents and purposes, stalled. Even Ben Bernanke, money printer extraordinaire, says that we’re [creating two separate societies][12] this way.

So, why cut off extended unemployment benefits? I mean, unless you’re a [brain-dead deficit hawk][13] or a “I’ve got mine so fuck the rest of you” Libertarian, they actually have a pretty [positive economic stimulus effect][14]. More so than the [pointless tax “cuts”][15] that we’re going to extend until we’re ass-broke, at any rate. The only reason I can think of involves pumping up the stock market, which currently [out-earns our manufacturing industry][16] as a percentage of GDP.
