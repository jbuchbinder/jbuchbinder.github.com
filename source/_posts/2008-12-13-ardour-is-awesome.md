I finally got around to upgrading the studio to use [ardour 2.7.1][1], from the stock version which comes with the Intrepid Ibex release of [Ubuntu Studio][2]. It took [minimal configuration][3] to get my [Behringer BCF2000 control surface][4] working, and it worked amazingly well. Unlike in the past when I had to manually bind controls to their functions in ardour, pretty much everything was automated, so besides forcing udev to create a static link for it (so that I could plug whatever in whenever I wanted to without disturbing the actual location in /dev) everything just \*worked\* when I brought jack ardour up for the first time. Iâ€™ve been using ardour since the pre-version-number days, and I have to say that this impressed the hell out of me. Paul, you rock.
