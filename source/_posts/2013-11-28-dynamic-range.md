As a photographer or cinematographer, I'm sure you've come into contact with
limitations in [dynamic range](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_range).
I have run into limitations with dynamic range in both the visual and audio
field, since anything that involves "real world" signals is going to 
potentially run up against the ability of the digital mediums on which we
rely to properly store the entire gamut of available analog data that we are
able to perceive with our eyes and ears. To combat the loss of data, computer
scientists and electrical engineers developed the process of dynamic range
compression, which is usually referred to as simple "compression". This
reduces the gamut of presented information to a digitally representable
format. There is, however, something which is lost -- and that is the
original dynamic range ; the amount of variance between the strongest and
weakest signal. In small doses, or when done with finesse, this provides the
ability to produce better sounding and better looking content in the digital
realm. When overused, we see results like the [loudness war](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudness_war).

I like to explore the more figurative aspects of many technical concepts, to 
which most avid readers of my work would attest. In that vein of ideas, consider
the derivative concept of dynamics as a function of cinematic tension/resolution
and feeling.

Much like a written work, cinematic works generally tend to follow a
"[plot/story arc](http://www.dailywritingtips.com/how-to-structure-a-story-the-eight-point-arc/)",
which have a number of basic stages, even if the presentation, order, and
presence will vary between works. As cinematographers, one of our jobs is to
attempt to portray the basic plot elements, character interactions, and other
potentially metaphysical aspects of the story through the lensing, lighting,
focal points, composition, and method of stabilization and capture we use.
*(I'm aware that there are other control points, but forgive me my omissions
for the sake of some semblence of brevity.)* For example, for a more
"cinéma vérité" style for a combat or heavy action sequence, a filmmaker could
choose to shoot with less stabilization, looser composition, and less staged
lighting, which would present the audience with the perception that the scene
is far closer to the work of a documentarian than a staged film scene. In
[Saving Private Ryan](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120815/), for example, the
battle scenes have a decreased exposure time, resulting in action appearing
far more caustic and (what we believe is) more realistic. This allows the
relative dynamics of the scenes in question to be raised to allow far more
tension and action to be shown, through simple camera work.

The issue with techniques like this begin to manifest themselves when they
begin to flatten the dynamic of a film work through rampant and flagrant
overuse. At some point, cinematographers realized that they could shoot
*entire films* with these techniques, ostensibly to raise those tension and
action levels to that same high. By doing this, they have effectively
flattened the dynamic range of their works, producing an effectively and
uniformly "loud" work. The questions that you might be asking are "why is this
a bad thing, and why should I care?"

We view things as deltas, or differences. We understand happiness because we
understand sadness, heat because we experience cold, and comfort and
companionship because we can contrast it with loneliness. If the range we are
give to deal with is only the "best parts", we begin to lose our ability to
appreciate it, and all of those things which should have made it special and
artistic become mere convention. Think about it -- if everyone screamed
everything at the same volume, rather than having varying levels of emphasis
and volume, wouldn't that screaming have lost its impact and importance?

Every technique that you have as a cinematographer or photographer is another
potential tool in your figurative tool box; but just because you have them
doesn't mean that you have to use one particular one *all the time*. Handheld
camerawork has its place, and even though modern technology has provided many
methods of stabilizing camera and lens motion, from the steadicam to image
stabilization/vibration reduction lens to three point shoulder rigs, we still
find many cinematographers intentionally introducing shake into their
footage. I wrote an [entire essay](http://jbuchbinder.com/2013/06/03/stabilization/) 
on the importance of stabilization, so I won't reiterate my grievances here.

It's important to understand why you're doing something rather than
simply doing it for convenience or convention. If you're using a wide open
aperture, are you doing it because you're having lighting issues, or simply
because you think that everything should be shot with the thinnest DOF
possible? Is there some sort of artistic reason why you chose to shoot with
a 24mm vs a 35mm lens for a particular shot? Are you using a tripod-based
shot rather than a steadicam for a reason? Asking questions and analyzing
your own work, as well as the work of others, is key to artistic growth, as
well as understanding how to use your skillset as a photographer or
cinematographer.

I am, by no means, at the top of the skill grouping for photography *or*
cinematography. Many of the entries I have authored here are products of
making mistakes, and they are the attempt I am making to keep others from
having to make some of the very same mistakes I have made. Even films and
other work which we don't particularly like as a whole may have a few 
setups or shots which provide food for thought. So, watch those films with
a critical eye, and hopefully we can all expand our "toolboxes", as well
as learn how to use them in a more effective manner. Good luck!
