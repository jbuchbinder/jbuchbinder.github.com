Hi, my name is **Benji**, and Iâ€™m a shitzu/terrier mix.

I was adopted from the pound by my mom, and I've been happy ever since. I
like to bark at things that aren't there, and I can dance around on my hind
legs like a circus animal.

My favorite nickname is "Benny".

*Update: Benji died in late 2010 in his sleep. Thanks to all of his friends who have sent their condolences.*
