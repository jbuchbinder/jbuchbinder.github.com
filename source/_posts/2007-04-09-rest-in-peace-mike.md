Most local musicians in Eastern Connecticut have heard of [Mike Praytor][2] of “The Sound Factory”, a local promoter and musician. He was found dead in his home this past Saturday, April 7th, 2007. There has been an enormous outpouring of support for his family, especially his two children, from the local music community.

It’s strange, I’m not really one for writing eulogies or waxing rhapsodic about life accomplishments ; I’ve been more of the mind that there is a certain aggrandizement which occurs after someone dies. Yet, I find myself unable to think of anything bad to say about Mike. He was a friend to everyone he came in contact with, a talented musician, loving father, and a tireless supporter of local music of every genre. You never realize the impact someone has had on your life until they aren’t around to do it any more, I guess.
