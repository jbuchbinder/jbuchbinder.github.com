  <div class="entry-content"><p>Even though a good portion of the work has been completed when you press the
shutter button, or stop rolling, since all of your planning and execution has
been completed, there&rsquo;s still a final step (or series of steps) to bring that
artistic effort to a presentable format.</p>

<p>Many people shoot with default (or very close to default) settings on their
camera or videocamera, and do simple &ldquo;post production&rdquo; by simply cropping or
cutting whatever comes out of their camera body. This is a very &ldquo;purist&rdquo; way
of going about shooting, but can also rob your end product of some of the
polish and slight adjustments which can take good pictures or footage and
make them into something extraordinary.</p>

<p>All of that being said, there&rsquo;s a limit to the types and amounts of post
production which can and should be used, much in the way that overproducing
a musical album can result in a homogenous and lifeless product, robbed of
the &ldquo;soul&rdquo; and variances which make it unique. You are the only person who
can decide how much, if any, post processing is right for your project or
other artistic endeavor.</p>

<p><strong>RAW versus JPEG/H.264</strong></p>

<p>With DSLR cameras being used for both photography and cinematography, there
are places where the &ldquo;processing&rdquo; aspect can be pushed off into the post
production process.</p>

<p>For photography, RAW format pictures can allow recovery past some of the
previously accepted limits of what would normally be considered lost or
unusable. Effectively, it allows you to make the decisions which are
normally pushed off on your camera&rsquo;s processor (the DIGIC processor(s),
for all of you Canon users). It adds an additional step to the
post-processing workflow, in that you&rsquo;ll need a piece of software like
<a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom.html">Adobe Lightroom</a> for Windows/Mac users, or if you&rsquo;re a Linux user like me,
<a href="http://rawstudio.org/">Raw Studio</a>. It also adds a significant amount of time to the
photographic post-processing workflow, in that there are a number of
additional parameters which can be adjusted, which would normally result
in image degradation, but can be adjusted in RAW images with little or no
deleterious effect. If you&rsquo;re a <a href="http://www.magiclantern.fm/">Magic Lantern</a> user, you can also
experiment with &ldquo;dual ISO&rdquo; images, which can create images with enormous
dynamic range through sensor tricks &mdash; but which adds an another step
before RAW processing, that of running a CR2HDR binary. (If you&rsquo;re
interested in trying this out, but don&rsquo;t want to compile a CR2HDR binary
for Windows or Linux, I have binaries available <a href="https://bitbucket.org/rufustfirefly/magic-lantern/downloads">here</a>)</p>

<p>For cinematography, there&rsquo;s a lot more to think about. Magic Lantern users
of Canon 5Dmk3 models (and some others, as well) have the option of being
able to shoot RAW video with some very fast CF cards. This adds a pretty
substantial amount of post-processing steps <em>before</em> your NLE (non-linear
editor) of choice enters the picture. There are a pretty wide swath of
applications which now support the Magic Lantern RAW format, including
<a href="http://www.magiclantern.fm/forum/index.php?action=printpage;topic=5557.0">RAWanizer</a>, but your best bet is to get involved with the Magic
Lantern forum if you want to begin working with a RAW workflow. The other
serious disadvantage is storage space. Standard H.264 video, which is
shot by most DSLR camera bodies, has issues with some digital artifacts in
certain scenarios, as well as some dynamic range issues (some of which can
be made better by use of flat color profiles like <a href="https://www.technicolorcinestyle.com/download/">Cinestyle</a>, but I&rsquo;ll
leave that for later) &mdash; but it produces fairly compact files, even at
1080p/24p (1920x1080 24fps progressive) resolution. RAW data can take
upwards of a gigabyte of space every 15-20 seconds. Your storage media
and backup solutions have to be able to deal with that, so it&rsquo;s something
to seriously consider before deciding to move a project to work with that
format.</p>

<p><strong>White Balance</strong></p>

<p>It used to be accepted that white balancing (determining where &ldquo;true white&rdquo;
lies in an image, compensating for varying light color temperatures) had to
be done &ldquo;in camera&rdquo;, before shots were taken. There are a number of tools
which allow this to be done in post-processing.</p>

<p>Photographers can do this when shooting with RAW camera images very
simply, as most RAW image processors have a simple white balancing tool. It&rsquo;s
still possible to do this with processed JPEG images, but with the
potential for losing some image data. Depending on how comfortable you are
with straying from the &ldquo;truest possible image&rdquo;, you can decide where you
feel comfortable dealing with white balancing.</p>

<p>Cinematographers have a pretty vast array of white balancing and color
correction plugins available for their NLE of choice. I&rsquo;m most familiar with
Adobe Premiere, so I&rsquo;d mention <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/VideoRoad/2010/05/using_the_fast_color_corrector.html">Fast Color Corrector</a> and
<a href="http://philipbloom.net/forum/threads/tutorial-color-grading-and-styling-with-colorista-ii.2528/">Red Giant Colorista II</a>, both of which offer pretty decent white
balancing capabilities, among other things. If you&rsquo;re concerned about
render speed, Fast Color Corrector seems to win out against Colorista II,
but Colorista II has some additional parameters and capabilities which
far outstrip what FCC has to offer. There&rsquo;s also software like
<a href="http://tv.adobe.com/watch/learn-premiere-pro-cc/color-grading-premiere-pro-sequences-in-speedgrade/">Adobe Speedgrade</a> and <a href="http://digitalfilms.wordpress.com/2013/02/02/davinci-resolve-workflows/">Blackmagic Design Davinci Resolve</a>, both
of which offer white balancing, color correction, and color grading
capabilities. There are a few threads <a href="http://forums.planet5d.com/threads/123505-Adobe-Speedgrade-vs-DaVinci-Resolve">comparing the two of them</a>.</p>

<p>The important distinction is whether or not you want to spend the time
to properly white balance your images or footage before you take pictures.
It&rsquo;s not always condusive to your shooting workflow to do so, and if this
is a factor, you should seriously consider some of the post-processing
options. It&rsquo;s obviously to your greatest advantage to have the most
accurate input images/footage to bring into your post-processing
workflow, but sometimes it&rsquo;s not pragmatic to take a completely purist
attitude in this regard.</p>

<p><strong>Exposure</strong></p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve all been bitten by changing light conditions, unexpected events, or
incorrect metering producing images or footage which has exposure problems.
If you&rsquo;re shooting RAW (or using Magic Lantern&rsquo;s Dual ISO hack), this is
an ideal place to examine using post-processing to correct these issues.</p>

<p>We would all like to properly expose everything (unless we have a
particular artistic reason for doing otherwise, since in the art of
photography or cinematography, there are generally exceptions to every
rule, rules were made to be broken, etc), but taking a post-processing
detour to correct such things is generally preferable to re-arranging a
shoot.</p>

<p><strong>Special Effects</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not a big fan of post-processing special effects, mainly because I
am a proponent of the idea that it takes some of the artistry out of
pulling off those same effects &ldquo;in camera&rdquo;. I do understand that there
are certain effects which would be either very difficult or downright
impossible to achieve without the use of computer generated effects &mdash;
but there&rsquo;s a lot of things which can be accomplished <em>without</em> that.</p>

<p>Lighting is something which I&rsquo;ve seen done in post, which generally
baffles me. It&rsquo;s something which is pretty simple to execute properly,
given a little time and effort. Saving images or footage with issues
might be a good use for that, but it&rsquo;s probably not something I would
recommend doing for everyday editing and processing.</p>

<p>For example, having someone &ldquo;eaten&rdquo; by light can be accomplished for
a cinematographer, simply by adjusting the fill light to blow out the
whites, then opening the iris of the lens (using a focus pulling kit,
or just a spare hand, for the less equipment-heavy among us) to allow
the fill light to &ldquo;eat&rdquo; the remainder of the image. That can be done
without any specific post-processing.</p>

<p><strong>Flat Color Profiles</strong></p>

<p>This is pretty much for cinematographers, since photographers could
simply take RAW photos &mdash; and cinematographers shooting RAW should
probably ignore this section, as well.</p>

<p>There are quite a few &ldquo;flat color profiles&rdquo; available for DSLR
(and other) bodies, such as the aforementioned Technicolor Cinestyle
profile and the <a href="http://www.similaar.com/foto/flaat-picture-styles/long-1.html">Flaat Picture Style</a>. These work by effectively
increasing the dynamic range being captured by the camera by storing
the values differently than the stock picture profile.</p>

<p>I highly recommend shooting with one, if you&rsquo;re not going to make the
leap to shoot RAW. It does add the additional step in post-processing
of having to adjust the blacks/whites and/or applying a corrective
LUT (look up table) to adjust the end product to look less &ldquo;washed
out&rdquo;. There are LUTs and plugins available for virtually every NLE
out there right now &mdash; and I suggest learning how to do this. The
improvement in the end product is substantial for relatively little
time investment.</p>

<p><strong>Audio Post</strong></p>

<p>This is another section just for cinematographers.</p>

<p>The audio which is recorded with footage is generally &ldquo;reference
audio&rdquo;, which is meant to be replaced by actual audio, generally
recorded with something like a <a href="http://tascam.com/product/dr-40/">Tascam DR-40</a> or <a href="http://www.zoom.co.jp/english/products/h4n/">Zoom H4n</a>
external recorder and a shotgun microphone. It&rsquo;s far outside the
scope of this to explain the majority of these technologies and
techniques, but sufficed to say that they produce far cleaner and
usable recordings than on-camera audio (even when using augmented
on-camera microphones, etc). If you can afford it, use external
audio, and have an experienced audio engineer perform some basic
post-production on your audio.</p>

<p>If you can&rsquo;t afford it, or don&rsquo;t have an audio engineer, there are
a few basic steps to get cleaner audio.</p>

<p>1) <em>Don&rsquo;t use the microphone built into the camera</em>. It sounds pretty
awful, and is noisy. Get a lav microphone for interviews, or a
directional hot-shoe mounted external microphone for anything else.</p>

<p>2) <em>Adjust the audio levels manually</em>. Automatic level adjustment is
going to be terrible. It&rsquo;s meant to avoid clipping, but it tends to
make the noise floor (the level of background noise) jump around as
the camera readjusts the audio recording level, so it may make your
life significantly more difficult when it comes time to adjust the
footage later. Adjust it to the loudest sound you&rsquo;re going to be
recording &mdash; then perhaps a click lower, for safety.</p>

<p>3) <em>Respect the inverse square law</em>. For those unfamiliar, sounds
drop at a logarithmic rate as you move away from the sound source,
following the same inverse square law which is used to figure light
source brightness. The closer you are to a recorded sounds, the
cleaner and better the source audio will be. Every object which a
sound hits will produce a &ldquo;reflection&rdquo; (much as light does). If that
reflection is equal or louder than the volume of the source sound,
you&rsquo;re going to get a pretty terrible sounding audio recording.</p>

<p>4) <em>Get the cleanest audio possible</em>. Try to cut down on external
noise sources. Never assume that you can clean something later on;
you should be trying to get clean audio. If something has to be
re-taken to avoid a lawnmower being run in the background, then you
should seriously consider doing it. It&rsquo;ll save you from pulling out
your hair.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure that this isn&rsquo;t a <em>comprehensive</em> list, but hopefully this
will help everyone get started with deciding what, if anything, to
relegate to their post-processing workflow. Good luck!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had started a post a few months ago, which I had tentatively titled &ldquo;Approximating Skill&rdquo;. It was a fairly scathing indictment of what I had refered to as the &ldquo;Instagram generation&rdquo;.</p>

<p>As anyone who has been following my recent posts here knows, I attach a lot of importance to the notion of &ldquo;skill&rdquo;, especially in relation to art forms where there are popular misconceptions regarding the ability to &ldquo;buy&rdquo; your way into a particular skill-set.</p>

<p>In &ldquo;<a href="/2013/05/03/gear-vs-skill/">Skill vs Gear</a>&rdquo;, I had tried to explain that, no matter how many toys or additional pieces were added into any mix, the most important variable is the skill of the operator/artist in control of the production. It seems like a fairly simple thing to understand, but in the muddied world of extensive post-production and devalued skill-sets, that common understanding is constantly called into question.</p>

<p>Take <a href="http://instagram.com/">Instagram</a>, for example. It&rsquo;s a fairly simple concept, being a marriage between Twitter-style <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign">hashtags</a> (don&rsquo;t get me started on that &mdash; we should just call it U+0023 and get it over with), social networking, and cameraphone photography. (I happen to particularly loathe cameraphone photography, except for the ubiquitous and universally available nature of cameraphones.) The issues, as far as I&rsquo;m concerned, begin to arise in the dual areas of devaluation and lack of appreciation.</p>

<p><strong>Devaluation</strong>. This comes into play when every Instagram (or insert other type of skill-sapping or replacing app here) user begins to assume that they, yes they, are capable of producing professional results. Malcolm Gladwell famously claimed that it took <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book)">10,000 hours</a> of time to amass enough skill to master a certain skill-set. I prefer to refer to <a href="http://enticingthelight.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Stages-of-a-Photographer.png">this chart</a> (ignore some of the strange and inappropriate labels &mdash; the sentiment is the important part). As perceived self-skill increases, valuation of others&#8217; skill-sets decreases. This explains much of the reluctance to hire professional photographers and cinematographers/videographers, or to value their skills so little that an insulting amount of compensation is considered &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; for their time and effort.</p>

<p><strong>Lack of appreciation</strong>. Autotune and Instagram are both partially to blame for this &mdash; but it seems as though actual skill is barely recognizable anymore, to a vast swath of the population, for any given skill-set. I do understand that the <a href="http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Dunning-Kruger_effect">Dunning-Kruger Effect</a> means that any person is going to assess their own skill-set incorrectly. This, however, reaches far beyond that conclusion. After having been subjected to hundreds, if not thousands, of hours of blown out and ill-colored photos, and subjected to far too many songs which have been pitch corrected beyond human recognition, the latest generation has mostly lost the ability to differentiate between &ldquo;faked&rdquo; output and true skill. I recently had an entire photoshoot (which I dutifully handed over to the photographed party) blown out, miscolored, and made to look like a bunch of terrible Instagram photos &mdash; all, supposedly, in the name of appealing to the younger generation, as they &ldquo;appreciate&rdquo; things that look like that. As far as faked output goes, it&rsquo;s not limited to amateurs; big budget Hollywood studios have been <a href="http://www.cracked.com/article_18664_5-annoying-trends-that-make-every-movie-look-same.html">exploiting basic digital correction</a> to make everything look the same &mdash; the Instagramification of movies (that article also points out the annoying &ldquo;shaky cam&rdquo; stuff that I had been discussing in my <a href="/2013/06/03/stabilization/">earlier post</a>). In the end, skills fall along the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">standard/normal distribution curve</a>, even if the skills represented by the vertical axis may be logarithmic in scale.</p>

<p><strong>The Hipster Effect</strong>. I realize that I only counted two areas earlier in this post, but this would lack something if I didn&rsquo;t mention the effect that the &ldquo;Hipster&rdquo; culture has had on perceived skills. Rather than reiterate every terrible think about Hipster culture, <a href="http://www.wolfgnards.com/index.php/2010/08/27/the-irony-of-the-ironic-hipsters-don-t-understand-irony">I&rsquo;ll let this guy do it for me</a>. I don&rsquo;t know if I can explain this better than <strong>there is no such thing as ironically bad music or photography</strong>. The misconception that there is has very deeply damaged the ability for the average hipster to properly appreciate music and photography, assuming that they are searching for ironically bad things, rather than attempting to appreciate skill. Crummy audio recordings, &ldquo;vintage looks&rdquo;, and other gimmicks serve to hide, rather than accentuate, the skills involved in the production of the underlying art.</p>

<p><strong>Processing/Post-Production</strong>. When you do not require initial skill to create something, but can merely &ldquo;<a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/this-looks-shopped">shop</a>&rdquo; your way out of any situation, the underlying skill is devalued, and sometimes forgotten. I&rsquo;ve been trying to emphasize the value of learning to create effects and the vast majority of the cinematic treatment of the mise-en-scène, rather than simply using a series of post-production tools to bend the footage to my will. This has more to do with the propensity for forgetting basic cinematic technique which comes with foregoing the steps involved with figuring out how to do this work on set. The real damnation seems to come when there is <em>no actual knowledge</em> of the underpinnings and workings of the art, and a novice decides to use post-processing <em>exclusive of skill</em>. This is the disease which is Instagram, Autotune, and Photoshop, in a nutshell.</p>

<p>The only way to fight this is to not concede defeat. If we are actually artists instead of simple camera jockeys, why shouldn&rsquo;t we be pushing for our craft and skill-set to receive the recognition which it deserves? I understand that some of the lost ground, in terms of general appreciation, has been lost &mdash; but hopefully we can keep the situation from getting much worse through education and perserverence.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>DSLR cinematography (the practice of cinematography using relatively inexpensive DSLR camera bodies, which were originally purposed for still photography) has been enjoying a sort of minature renaissance over the last few years.</p>

<p>I was pleasantly surprised to find out that Shane Carruth&rsquo;s new movie, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2084989/">Upstream Color</a>, was shot entirely on a DSLR body. The information I&rsquo;ve been reading indicates that he used a Panasonic GH2 DSLR body, with a few lenses, including the <a href="http://slrgear.com/reviews/showproduct.php/product/1577/cat/110">Rokinon 85mm f/1.4</a> (which I highly recommend). It scored at Sundance, and if it hadn&rsquo;t been for a few &ldquo;behind the scenes&rdquo; photos, it might not have been quite that apparent.</p>

<p>Of course, Carruth also ended up using some <a href="http://www.kenrockwell.com/voigtlander/">Voigtlander</a> glass, which is by no stretch of the imagination cheap/affordable for cash-strapped indie filmmakers. There&rsquo;s an interesting write-up on the whole thing <a href="http://www.eoshd.com/content/10309/gh2-shot-sci-fi-upstream-color-breaks-300000-mark-at-the-us-box-office">at EOSHD</a>.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a reason why I bring up &ldquo;Upstream Color&rdquo; &mdash; and it&rsquo;s a point that I&rsquo;ve been trying to make, off and on, for the past year or so. That film grossed over 300k dollars at the box office, and was shot on a small, inexpensive camera body. Still, it produced stunning visuals and did not seem to suffer from most of the &ldquo;fatal flaws&rdquo; that most seem to ascribe to DSLR cinematography, in general. The point, boiled down to its most essential component, is that the most important piece of equipment you&rsquo;ve got is between your forehead and your nose. You can&rsquo;t buy your way into it, and you can&rsquo;t just assume that if you own it, you can shoot as well as cinematographer X who has the current successful movie on the big screen.</p>

<p>Whether or not you&rsquo;re a big fan of &ldquo;Act of Valor&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Fast and Furious&rdquo; franchise, you can still appreciate Shane Hurlbut&rsquo;s <a href="http://blog.planet5d.com/2012/02/act-of-valor-leap-of-faith/">extensive use of Canon EOS 5D mk III bodies</a>. He has had a series of posts on his blog praising not only the relative inexpensive nature of the 5D bodies, but also their versatility.</p>

<p>For every person who says &ldquo;I shoot on the RED ONE&rdquo; and produces sub-standard output, or bemoans not being able to afford an ARRI which would &ldquo;really make a beautiful movie&rdquo; &mdash; I call foul on that entire argument. Even contending with a more limited dynamic range (a common DSLR problem), a top resolution of 1080p for shooting, and mostly commodity lenses, Carruth managed to produce something beautiful. It&rsquo;s not down to the equipment you buy, folks, it&rsquo;s how you use it.</p>

<p>Good luck.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Cinematography is, first and foremost, an artform. That being said, I&rsquo;d like to
also emphasize the caveat that it is a <em>technical</em> artform, and requires a
certain degree of skill and/or technical proficiency to be able to consistently
create artful work.</p>

<p>It could be argued that no, this isn&rsquo;t the case, based solely on the
promulgation of iDevice and consumer-grade video device footage. This type of
footage does not require a modicum of skill, or even practice. In the same way
that it is possible to take a fantastic picture with an Android or iOS device,
it is <em>possible</em> to film usable content with a consumer grade device &mdash; but
not only is it technically limiting (based on the sensors, alone), but it
offers virtually no control over the footage, other than some basic focus and
exposure controls. I would argue that the resulting footage could result in
decent quality output if either a) the operator had an artistic eye, and was
able to use their technology with some skill/proficiency, or b) they were
extremely lucky. However, I digress.</p>

<p>One of the most consistently over-used (and misused, incidentally) is
&ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cin%C3%A9ma_v%C3%A9rit%C3%A9">cinéma vérité</a>&rdquo;. In modern cinematographer parlance, it has come to mean
any footage which resembles that of an unskilled operator, which theoretically
lends an air of realism and observationalism (see any first year film school
book on observational cinema if you&rsquo;re unfamiliar with the concept) to a
piece. It&rsquo;s easier, for example, to immerse a viewer in the world of a
Zombie Apocalypse if they feel as though they could be the one sitting behind
the camera.</p>

<p>This concept has been expanded, partially through the over-saturation of
&ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_television">reality television</a>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Found_footage_(genre)">found footage</a>&rdquo; genre pieces. Far from
being necessitated by the artistic content of those genres, it is rather
<a href="http://alifetimeindarkrooms.blogspot.com/2012/02/okay-for-pitys-sake-enough-with-found.html">much more profitable</a>, and can be executed with far crummier equipment
and with a lower technical skill (and ostensibly artistic skill) element. I&rsquo;m
not going to argue that there is <em>no</em> artistic or technical skill involved
in making either of those genres of television or film, as that would be
foolhardy &mdash; and there are always exceptions to the general rule.</p>

<p>Cinéma vérité is a bit more troubling when used as an excuse for technical
incompetence, lack of technique, or lack of foresight and caring. Most
recently, I&rsquo;ve heard shaky and unstabilized footage &ldquo;explained away&rdquo; as
being necessitated by the genre of cinéma vérité &mdash; and I&rsquo;m not buying that
excuse. The majority of footage in film can and should be stabilized, as
well as planned out and executed in a thoughtful manner. That&rsquo;s where the
&ldquo;art&rdquo; of cinematography lies; otherwise, you&rsquo;re just a camera jockey, no
matter how fancy your equipment may be. As I&rsquo;ve said before, the most
important piece of equipment you own is your eye; everything else just helps
your execution.</p>

<p>There is no excuse for shaky footage in this age of
<a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/consumer/standard_display/Lens_Advantage_IS">image stabilization systems</a> and <a href="http://littlegreatideas.com/stabilizer/diy/">inexpensive stabilizers</a> which you
can build for a few dollars worth of parts from your local home improvement
store. It adds a lot of cinematographic value and apparent production value
to have more stable shots. I&rsquo;d prefer not to experience vertigo when watching
a simple walking tracking shot, when possible. One of my favorite &ldquo;why the
hell did that guy do that&rdquo; moments was in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119173/">G.I. Jane</a> (of which I&rsquo;m not
a fan), where the combat scenes are filmed with what appears to be
<em>intentional</em> camera shake. Far from transporting the viewer into the middle
of the morass, it only conveys confusion and vertigo. Used in more moderate
amounts, it could have proved much more effective, in my opinion.</p>

<p>Even if you&rsquo;re dead-set on the idea of making your next film project using
the &ldquo;cinéma vérité&rdquo; genre, there are a few things you should consider before
proceeding unstabilized:</p>

<ol>
<li><em>Does this somehow add to the feel of the film?</em> If you are introducing
camera shake into your cinematography, it should be adding something
tangible, like a certain feeling, to a scene.</li>
<li><em>Am I overusing this?</em> If you&rsquo;re shooting every shot this way, you might
want to reconsider your methodology, unless you&rsquo;re shooting a guerilla
documentary.</li>
<li><em>Am I doing this due to a technical limitation?</em> If you are using
&ldquo;cinéma vérité&rdquo; as an excuse for being unable to stabilize your footage,
invest in a cheap stabilization system, IS lenses, a tripod, or any of
the other ways of creating less shaky footage. They&rsquo;re too inexpensive
to let shake stand in the way of otherwise great footage.</li>
</ol>


<p>Good luck!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I remember a conversation I had with my brother, a few years back. He was
talking about the amount of photographic equipment which he had been dumping
money into purchasing, in the hopes of improving the output from his camera.
After months, if not years, of ordering and collecting equipment, he thought
that <em>one more thing</em> would make some difference. He then had an epiphany,
after viewing a photo of a sunset taken with a $12 disposable camera. The
full comment was:</p>

<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s even more impressive that such a sweet shot was taken with that cheapass Dakota. Every time I get the fool notion into my head that some new and expensive piece of equipment will make me a better photographer, I look at this picture and think, &#8220;ah, yes. Right.&#8221;</p></blockquote>


<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about this, as I acquire more cinematography gear. At
which point does it become less about the gear, and more about the wetware?
(Wetware, for those who are unaware, refers to your biological &ldquo;meat
equipment&rdquo;.)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m divided on this point. I do feel that there are certain limitations
inherent in not possessing the proper tool for the job. To put a concrete
example together: if you&rsquo;re using a Canon EOS T2i, your image quality isn&rsquo;t
going to be the same as using a much higher quality camera and sensor
(sticking to the DSLR for this point), but it&rsquo;s theoretically possible to
clean up footage in post-production to <em>approach</em> the type of output which
you could acchieve with a higher-grade sensor and optics. However, if you&rsquo;re
using a standard kit lens on that camera (which probably tops out at an f/3.5
if you&rsquo;re really, really lucky), you&rsquo;re not going to be able to get the
narrow depth-of-field which is associated with most &ldquo;cinematic&rdquo; shots. A
<a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/consumer/products/cameras/ef_lens_lineup/ef_50mm_f_1_8_ii">Canon 50mm f/1.8 &ldquo;plastic fantastic&rdquo;</a> lens (on which I&rsquo;ve seen far too many
budding cinematographers rely exclusively) is an interesting start, but can&rsquo;t
completely replace a series of really wide open glass primes (sub-f/2.0).</p>

<p>The flip side of the coin is the point which my brother had made; if your
eye sucks, your footage sucks. A lot of the cinematographers (and just plain
old camera operators) with which I&rsquo;ve come in contact have bemoaned not
owning a RED ONE, or even a higher grade DSLR camera body &mdash; and assuming
that any decent footage I can pull has everything to do with the equipment
I&rsquo;m using, and nothing to do with my ability to use said equipment.</p>

<p>Years ago, I remember a gig I had, as a bass player. At the time, I had
brought a <a href="http://www.vintagewashburn.com/Bass/Mercurybass.html">Washburn MB-6</a> (a strange Mercury series instrument with
fantastic action, scored on eBay for very little money), and had finished
a really heart-felt set. Some jackass came up to me and complimented the
instrument.  I figured, from that point on, I would just assume that if
someone commented on my instrument, they were implicitly insulting me, by
implying that the instrument provided the quality which they admired, and
that anyone would have been able to do the same, given the chance to play
that instrument.</p>

<p>To sum up, you need a good eye &mdash; more than anything else &mdash; but it&rsquo;s also
important to have the right equipment for the right purpose. Oh, and don&rsquo;t
forget to stabilize your shots &hellip;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After much hemming, hawing, and gnashing of teeth, I&rsquo;m migrating my years of sporadic blogging from <a href="http://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a> to <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>. It seems to integrate a little bit better with both my &ldquo;command line ethos&rdquo; and my workflow. I&rsquo;m sure (for anyone keeping track) that there are probably going to be some weird formatting issues, potentially broken pages, and other incidences of oddness in some places. Please excuse the mess, we&rsquo;re remodeling.</p>

<p>In addition to the move, I&rsquo;m trying to move away from blog entries regarding political events &mdash; not because I should be worried about potential ramifications for my professional/public life &mdash; but rather because there&rsquo;s only a certain amount of pissing into the wind that a man can do before he gets tired of having a mouthful of piss. That&rsquo;s not to say that there won&rsquo;t be <em>any</em> political stuff here, but there&rsquo;s going to be far less.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1></h1>

<p>It’s the day before the 2012 Presidental Election. I’m disappointed, as usual, by the choice of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitt_Romney">far right</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama">center right</a> “choices” that we have. I again am forced into the decision of either voting for the preferable third party candidate, with whom I share views on the vast majority of issues (<a href="http://www.jillstein.org/">Dr. Jill Stein</a>, for anyone wondering — I still think Ron Paul is a complete crankcase, and Gary Johnson is way too “fuck Federalism” for my taste) and effectively helping to elect an out-of-touch sociopathic plutocrat butt-munch, or vote the “lesser of two evils” and probably end up with a Democrat who is going to “<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/obama-says-hell-renew-pursuit-of-grand-bargain-offering-specifics-on-agenda/2012/10/24/0e2b843c-1e0e-11e2-9cd5-b55c38388962_story.html">Grand Bargain</a>” away the Great Society programs. All of that being said, I have a few serious issues with this election cycle.</p>

<p><em>Throwing bullshit at the wall to see what sticks / low information idiots destroy America.</em> Don’t bother reading Politifact. Their attempt to be “non partisan” by rating the attempt to replace Medicare with a privatized program (effectively ending the program as we know it) as “half true” (and then upgrading to “<a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/03/barack-obama/obama-says-romney-wants-turn-medicare-voucher-prog/">mostly true</a>“, after rounds of pounding), simply because the word “voucher” was used to describe the festering husk of Medicare after it had been dessicated by years of crap like “Medicare Advantage” and Governor Rick Scott’s <a href="http://www.wusf.usf.edu/news/2010/06/18/whistleblowers_say_rick_scott_knew_about_medicare_fraud">side ventures into fraud</a>, then given out as coupons/vouchers to purchase overpriced and underregulated private insurance. You know, after “Obamacare is repealed” and the jackholes in the insurance industry can go back to fucking people in any way they see fit — government regulation and oversight is apparently for places like Europe, Canada — hell, anywhere but here. But I digress.</p>

<p>The whole idea that Romney had been running a campaign which has profited greatly by effectively lying about the other guy — wholesale, mind you, not the usual half-truths we see from Presidental campaigns in the United States — is pretty sickening. A friend who works in the Connecticut prison system recently mentioned that he was going to vote for Romney because “Obamacare is going to make me pay more for my health insurance; and I have to look out for myself”. Some jackasses at work told him this, and he believed it — even though it’s patently and demonstrably false. As I saw somewhere on the interwebs “Obama isn’t a brown skinned guy who gives out free healthcare and hates rich people — you’re thinking of Jesus.” People apparently will follow their rampant self-interest, Grover-Norquist-style, even if it means screwing the shit out of everyone else. Not cool, America, not cool.</p>

<p><em>Voting for a third party candidate isn’t going to change squat, even if they won.</em> I can’t stress this enough. Enough of the country lives in some weird mix of medieval England and the 1950s, and votes as a bloc for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Santorum">loudest, crassest bible-thumper</a> in any election cycle (think of Dubya, who shouldn’t have been able to win an election cycle against a warm jar of Russian piss, had the contest been set up that way). Look, we’re going to have tea-hadist, teanderthals, whatever you want to call them, in the House of Representatives and the Senate. Low information, Dunning-Kruger-Effect proving, “self made” government haters, who don’t believe in science, and sure as hell don’t believe in the government to which they have been elected. Nothing is going to go well that way — and it’s a pretty good indictment of why both direct and representative democracy do not function well in a country full of ill informed voters. Voters, to which “intellectualism” is an anathema to their way of life. I don’t want a President or Representative with whom I can drink a can of local alcoholic swill — I want someone who is smarter than I am; someone who is intellectually invested in leading. I want someone who actually gives a half a fuck about *everyone*, not just the guys with money or the guys who are the loudest at the moment. A Green Party president, however nice, is only one leg of the trifecta of United States government. They might be able to stop some wars, and perhaps appoint less awful corporatists to the Supreme Court — but they don’t make the laws around here. Educate, educate, educate — that’s the only way out of this shit-hole. (Also, don’t even think about “Charter Schools”. They’re not only *not* a panacea, but by effectively removing the top tier of students and privatizing education, we’re removing the only trappings of equality which the lower end of the socioeconomic chain has…)</p>

<p><em>Voter disenfranchisement under the guise of “voter fraud”.</em> I don’t even need to really go into this, since so many other people have done it so well. I’ll lazy link to <a href="http://bobcesca.com/blog-archives/2012/11/six-hour-lines-and-voter-suppression-in-florida-and-ohio.html">Bob Cesca</a>, the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/voter-suppression-america">ACLU</a>, <a href="http://www.salon.com/2012/10/25/how_gop_voter_suppression_could_win_florida_and_the_white_house_for_romney/">Salon</a>, and <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/11/timeline-history-voter-suppression">Mother Jones</a>. I would find something a bit more right-leaning, but they’re still bitching about a statistically irrelevant excuse for disenfranchising <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-250_162-57511312/study-voter-id-law-would-exclude-up-to-700000-young-minorities/">primarily minority voters</a> — which apparently <a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/video-republicans-caught-committing-voter-fraud-only-registering-romney-voters">those same asshats have been perpetrating</a>. Stay classy, conservatives.</p>

<p><em>Military industrial complex leg-humping time.</em> We need to find out who is going to <a href="http://www.iraqbodycount.org/">bomb more dark people into pits in the sand</a>, and fast! Candidates are now trying to <a href="http://www.tonysrants.com/military/breaking-five-hundred-generals-and-admirals-endorse-mitt-romney/">rack up military endorsements</a> as fast as they can. This does not bode well for not killing people unnecessarily, as you can probably guess. I mean, when you frame the “debate” (which there really isn’t, at this point) as “keeping us safe”, you already know what the outcome is going to be, since both major political parties are completely in the tank for <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2010/mar/28/opinion/la-oe-hayden28-2010mar28">The Long War</a>. We haven’t been attacked by another country since Pearl Harbor, guys. And, in case you didn’t notice, the terrorists who flew planes into our buildings did so primarily because <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motives_for_the_September_11_attacks">we’ve been dicking with their countries for years</a>. Noam Chomsky got his <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/fighting_words/2011/05/chomskys_follies.html">ass chewed out by Chris Hitchens</a> for saying just that (not that I agree with Chris Hitchens’s views on the Iraq War, it’s just interesting that he thought it worthy of a piece in Slate). Honestly, I think Chomsky is a bit more knowledgeable and trustworthy on the subject than Hitchens — but again, I digress.</p>

<p><em>Trying to discredit math.</em> I wish I were kidding about this, since it is vaguely reminiscent of the same anti-intellectualism sentiment portrayed by Dick Nixon, and shows that the vast majority of people like to live in some sort of weird bubble. You know, the kind where “you’re for us, or you’re a fucking idiot”. Nate Silver, who has been <a href="http://www.advocate.com/politics/media/2012/10/28/nate-silver-laughs-accusation-he-too-effeminate-analyze-polls">vilified by Romney bootlickers for giving the answers straight from the math</a> demonstrates the bizarre “bubble world” that the GOP candidate has around him, reminiscent of the same “information bubble” of the less-than-venerable George W Bush.</p>

<p><em>Redefining what it means to be a “businessman”.</em> Have you ever seen the movie “<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102609/">Other People’s Money</a>“? Take away the empathy and life lessons learned, and you’ve got Willard Romney. “Leveraged buyouts”, especially when accomplished with a few million dollars of seed capital from your old man, have squat to do with the Conservative ideal of the job creator wunderkind. Seriously. Leveraged buyouts involve using other people’s money to purchase a controlling instance in a functional company, and saddle it with the burden of paying not only the original capital for its own takeover back, but also sucking the marrow of the company out to pay yourself a hefty sum for the pleasure of having downsized and screwed the hell out of that same company. It may be business (vulture capitalism at its very “best”), but it’s certainly not “business experience” in any relevant context to a nation’s economy, assuming that you were willing to accept the framing that a government should be run like a business, which it shouldn’t. (Quick rundown of that logic: Business’s primary motive is profit, whereas governments have to serve the populace without regard to financial status or profit. Governments also print their own money. It’s not the same thing, guys. It’s like saying that you can be the best train conductor *evar* because you have a driver’s license or learner’s permit.)</p>

<p><em>Rampant self-interest trumping rational societal decisions.</em> Norquist proved this years ago in California; people simply will not vote for things that cost them money, even if it makes society better and enriches the country. I’m not sure if this is a “Boomer generation” thing, or if we’re just turning into selfish, ignorant, navel-gazing fuckwads through cultural inundation. I’ve seen people use the specter of “tax increases” as a reason for voting the GOP party line, even when those supposed “tax increases” aren’t born out by reality. Jeez, if you get your news from a crazy idiot like Glenn Beck (theblaze.com, anyone?), do you really think it’s going to somehow shape your decisions in some sort of informed and non-navel-gazing context?</p>

<p>I’ll end this with a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efKguI0NFek">George Carlin quote</a>: “If you’ve got selfish, ignorant citizens, you’re going to get selfish ignorant leaders.” I don’t think I could have said it better, George.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1></h1>

<p>So, the 2012 United States Presidental Election is effectively between Barack Obama and Willard “Mitt” Romney. I don’t think I can stress how little this registers on my “give-a-fuck-o-meter”, although I have been inundated by dire prognostications regarding the end of our “American Way of Life ™” (whatever that is) and a lot of scare-tactic advertising campaigns unleashed by the virtually unlimited flow of corporate money (or as Constitutional Originalist fuckwads like Antonin Scalia would say, “free speech”) into the current election cycle.</p>

<p>The problem is, there <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/">isn’t really a horse race to be had</a>. When FiveThirtyEight is pushing a 70 percent chance of a fairly popular incumbent president retaining a seat, one could wonder how the news media cycle could possibly make anything of it. As of this weekend, the Budgetary Wunderkind Paul Ryan has joined Mitt Romney’s unexciting ticket — and it doesn’t make any damn difference. Mittens ain’t winning this election, folks. We can show as many “real ‘muricans” as we can cram on the television, spitting opinions out of both sides of their figurative asses, but it’s not going to affect the outcome of this election. Well, unless the entire point of this chest-beating is going to be making a Mitt Romney victory seem plausible enough so that, if the need arises, disenfranchising voters can be made to seem to more naturally produce a victory for a statistical underdog. You know, if I were into conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>As far as policies go, I don’t agree with any of the Republican candidates’ policies. That’s my general disclosure: I don’t believe dry humping stacks of Atlas Shrugged is going to magically cure the economy, and I don’t believe that dropping government involvement in economics and allowing self regulation will somehow stimulate anything other than the same massive greed and theft we’ve seen already. However, for the most part, both parties are pretty closely aligned on most of the substantial issues.</p>

<p><em>Both parties are going to continue stacking bodies in other countries in wars we don’t belong in, and are going to continue funding the military at bank-busting levels.</em></p>

<p><em>Both parties are going to eschew any audit of the Federal Reserve</em> (yeah, yeah, I know, Ron Paul and I coincide on something — even a broken crackpot is right once a day) <em>or any prosecution of the fuckers who blew up the global economy for their own person gain.</em> (If you don’t believe me on that one, check out Bill Black’s take on it. They’ve done bad, criminally prosecutable things. Obama won’t prosecute because he’s scared that he’ll appear to be discouraging “business”, and Mittens won’t touch them because his business ethics and interests are pretty closely aligned with those jackals.)</p>

<p><em>Both parties are going to continue pushing “tax cuts” as economic stimulus.</em> They aren’t, at least not *lasting* economic stimulus. If we gave a shit about decreasing unemployment or “job creation”, we would be pushing another WPA, not giving handjobs to banksters.</p>

<p><em>Both parties will get rid of Medicare and Social Security.</em> They may not talk about it, but both are going to do it, eventually. Simpson-Bowles was commissioned by the *Obama* administration, and Mittens has made the Paul Ryan budgetary plan of voucher-izing (read: privatizing) Social Security and Medicare a major plank of his campaign. Apparently, “very serious” people want you to fucking do everything on your own, because they don’t believe you’re anything but a Randian moocher….</p>

<p>All they have for differences, at least in the running of their campaigns, are wedge issues. One supports abortion rights, another doesn’t. One is into allowing religious exemptions to health coverage, another isn’t. One is into the DREAM Act, one has a “nuanced” position (or whatever he’s decided his position is today — I don’t think the polls from “real ‘muricans” have come in yet today).</p>

<p>We’re getting the Status Quo, folks. We never had a damn chance, either; both establishment parties are owned by the same basic money sources, and you’d better believe that they’re getting their money’s worth.</p>

<p>Before anyone accuses me of leaving out Senator Ron Paul: <a href="http://dissentingjustice.blogspot.com/2011/08/five-reasons-why-ron-paul-should-never.html">he’s a fucking crank</a>. <a href="http://world.std.com/~mhuben/libindex.html">Libertarianism is a fucking crank “philosophy”</a>, and his bullshit disregard for other people, in the guise of individualism, is going to hurt more people than it helps. <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2011/05/earth-to-libertarians-private-parties-have-coercive-power-too.html">Government isn’t the only coercive force</a>, people. More importantly, if you’re fine with state government but hate the federal government — we tried that “exceptionally limited Federal Government” thing with the Articles of Confederation. It failed pretty spectacularly, so stop asking for a do-over, please.</p>

<p>The current paradigm, being pushed by the so-called “right” and “centrist right”, is that people don’t deserve anything other than what they “earn”. It’s an interesting wet-dream, which pays homage to the fraudulent concept of the meritocracy. If you’ve been paying attention for the last 20 years, we don’t have a meritocracy. Those who do well by others and play by the rules do *not* finish first, but those willing to loot, pillage, and burn — they are our new *Gods*. We deify CEOs, in the vain hope that we, too, may ascend to the Olympian summits with them, to enjoy the fruits of our Job Creator mojo. Honestly, I’m not sure whether the people pushing this fanticrap (a mixture of fantasy and crap, for the uninitiated) believe it, making them fools, or are using it to get ahead, making them scoundrels; regardless, if you hear someone trying to spread this particular Gospel of Supply Side Economics, try to make sure they end up on the outer side of your front door.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1></h1>

<p>I was listening to an FM talk-radio host (I know, I know, when will I ever learn…) this afternoon, and caught a peculiar rant. He was complaining about how terrible the public sector (and government in general) was compared to the private sector, based on two events.</p>

<p>The first was that he had bought a large amount of classical music using Amazon’s “one click” service, which he had “downloaded to a cloud driver [sic]“. He was able to listen to this music almost immediately following his purchase.</p>

<p>The second was that he had received a call from a local town tax collector, saying that he owed excise tax on a car. He had told the woman that he had sold it already, and she told him that he would have to bring paperwork from the RMV (in Massachusetts they tend to call the “Department of Motor Vehicles” the “Registrar of Motor Vehicles”) indicating that he had, indeed, sold the car. When he questioned why she couldn’t do it herself because “you have a computer in front of you”, the woman told him that it “isn’t my job to help you.”</p>

<p>At face value, these stories seem to confirm the free-market world viewpoint that private enterprise is more efficient than public institutions. However, there are a few problems with this story — namely that we’re really not comparing apples to apples, unless you’re living in the world of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/">The Matrix</a> or (ugh) <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113243/">Hackers</a>, which have about as much to do with modern computing technology as a rock tends to resemble a Star Trek phaser, or a phone booth has the same abilities as the TARDIS (if you prefer a Doctor Who reference instead of a Star Trek reference).</p>

<p>Amazon is a commercial company. They own every part of what they’re doing, and the only “standards” to which they conform (in this instance) is using HTTPS and MPEG Layer 3 audio encoding to deliver content. Everything else is part of their infrastructure. They own the entire thing — and more importantly, they’re just a reseller. They essentially produce nothing — just tack a profit on top for delivering something in an accessible way.</p>

<p>The RMV is a public institution, which means that they most likely have purchased a suite of software to manage their data (and it’s probably ten or twenty years old). If it resembles the software used in other states, it’s pretty useless for anything other than its primary functions, because it was designed by a lowest-bid contractor to conform to a particular set of RFP standards. It probably does what it’s supposed to do pretty well. Interfacing with other software suites, particularly those not written by the same software vendor — not so much. I cut my teeth in the IT industry writing conversion software (back when I was 11 or 12 years old), and believe me, *nothing* speaks to anything easily without a particular set of standards to do so. Most town tax collectors receive a data dump from their motor vehicle registry/department (and vice versa), which is imported into their local software. There isn’t some Hackers-like ability for the two systems to talk to each other. Leave that crap for bad movies and bad TV shows (Horatio from CSI, anyone?) — computers simply don’t work that way.</p>

<p>I’m sure most people with little or no interest in the intricacies of data import/export probably tuned out half-way through that last paragraph. It’s not particularly exciting stuff — yet it’s very important to understand in the context of the initial narrative.</p>

<p>This vaguely resembles the traditional right-wing meme that “poor people caused the economic collapse” which occurred in 2008. It has been <a href="http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2011/11/examining-the-big-lie-how-the-facts-of-the-economic-crisis-stack-up/">debunked repeatedly</a> — and yet the meme lives on. In a recent poll, <a href="http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2011/04/12/civil-war-still-divides-americans/">42% of Southerners</a> still cling to the notion that the “Civil War” was fought to preserve “States’ Rights” rather than simply being a way to exploit human labor, even though it’s very easy to demonstrably show that the primary motivation, both <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origins_of_the_American_Civil_War">economic and social/political</a>, was maintaining the status quo of a slave-owning set of states. You can’t simplify a complicated argument, unless you want to lose the meaning which is meant to be present in that argument.</p>

<p>Or, you could argue that this is all the end-result of cognitive bias. Maybe people see the government as broken because they *expect* to see it that way, and ignore evidence which is contradictory to their preconceived notions.</p>
