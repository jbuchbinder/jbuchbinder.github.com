As part of setting up the [Blackmagic Production Camera 4K](http://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/blackmagicproductioncamera4k),
I have been trying to put together a solid, fairly low-cost set of
accessories for the camera body.

I became aware of a low-cost Chinese cage for the BMCC/BMPC4K
bodies manufactured by an outfit called
"[Xiamen Came Photographic Equipment Co., Ltd.](http://www.came-tv.com/)",
which are available sporting both top and bottom 15mm rail mounts, 
along with the normal mounting options and handles present with
most cage designs. The cage in question is available for
[$198, shipping included, from the manufacturer](http://www.came-tv.com/came06-bmcc-cage-for-blackmagic-design-cinema-camera-15mm-rail-p-477.html).

My unit arrived today, via DHL, in a box which seemed almost
Ikea-esque in its packing. First thing to note, which is not
indicated either on the website or the packaging: "some assembly
required". Secondly -- no instructions. Thankfully, the entire
assembly procedure seemed pretty obvious with the provided
Allen wrenches. I noticed that there is a 5/8" mount on the
bottom of the unit (as well as a 1/4"-20 mount) for attaching to
the fluid head or quick-release plate of your choosing. This wasn't
indicated on the website, but I had my suspicions, which were
thankfully confirmed.

The first major issue I encountered was the lack of four of the
required screws for assembly. Undaunted, I took a quick trip to 
the nearest "home improvement" store, and purchased four
M4-.70 x 12 bolts with phillips heads (in packs of two), which
worked like a charm.

The second slightly annoying issue was that one of the included
30cm 15mm rods was completely unthreaded, so it wouldn't be
possible to attach it to any other rods, should it need to be
extended. The inclusion of the rods was a bit of a plus, so I
can't really be too upset about that.

The build quality, once assembled, is quite good. The CAME-06
cage is machined properly, and does not interfere with the
operation of the BMPC4K unit at all, and has enough mount points
to allow me to put handles, arms, and other accessories on it,
which was the secondary purpose of purchasing the cage, after
being able to properly mount the camera on a decent QR plate.

Additionally, it has a set of Hirth joints on either side,
ostensibly for attaching handle mounts. I have no use for them
at the moment, but they seem to be workable.

As the next step up in price is another 70$, and this unit
arrived from China in less than four business days from my
initial order, the annoyance of a $1.00 bolt purchase seems
miniscule, considering the usability of the cage itself. It
isn't a full system, like the Tilta, Lanparte, and others,
but can be built into a system incrementally.

Verdict: Know what you're getting yourself into. If you want
a pre-assembled unit, next day shipping, and would rather pay
more money for the lack of inconvenience, you should avoid the
CAME-06. It's a good deal for the price, however.

Good luck!
