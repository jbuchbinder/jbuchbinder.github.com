I have been working on an interface with [Quest Diagnostics][1] to be able to automagically import [HL7][2] v2.3 messages into [FreeMED][3]. They were nice enough to furnish me with some documentation, and I have an [alpha-quality][4] implementation ready for some beating in one of our alpha sites. Now that 0.8.0 is out, Iâ€™m working steadily on a 0.8.1 release, with mostly bugfixes, some rearchitecturing, and a few nice features like this one (hopefully).
