It’s final; I have moved [FreeMED][1], a six-year old project with a CVS tree that old, to a new [replicated subversion repository][2] system. This should let me spend far less time fighting with [sourceforge’s][3] CVS servers, as well as provide an easier way to maintain the large number of files and directories in FreeMED.

We’re less than a week from the launch of [FreeMED 0.8.0][4], [REMITT 0.3][5] and [phpwebtools 0.4.5][6], which will be released together, and everything is in deep freeze, so I will be only committing packaging changes and extreme paper bag bug fixes over the next week. Then we branch the code into stable and unstable, and start some serious development work …
