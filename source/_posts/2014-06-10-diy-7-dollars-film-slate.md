I can't claim credit for this one -- my production designer got the idea to
use an inexpensive slate "prop" and modify it slightly to allow the use of
erasable whiteboard markers. These are usually a bit more than seven dollars,
and we didn't have the time to wait for one to arrive in the mail for the
shoot in question.

There are only two pieces of "hardware" which are required to make this,
along with a few pieces of duct tape, a sharpie, a ruler, and whatever 
whiteboard markers and erasers you are planning to use on the finished
slate.

You will need to buy these two items from a [Five Below](http://www.fivebelow.com/) discount shop:

 * Slate Prop - $5
 * [8.5 x 11 Eraseable Whiteboard](http://www.fivebelow.com/8-5-x-11-neon-dry-erase-boards.html) - $2

*Apologies for not giving a product link for the slate prop -- I had trouble finding it on the Five Below site. I assure you, it does exist...*

## Assembly Instructions

1. Break the frame of the whiteboard, and remove the cardboard backing and
   the broken frame. You should now have a piece of unencumbered whiteboard.

2. Position the whiteboard over the slate prop's useless slate writing. You
   can't write on the slate with chalk, so it is pretty useless as-is.
   Center it as best you can, then use strips of duct or gaff tape to attach
   the whiteboard surface to the clapper.

3. Use the ruler as a straight-edge to draw sharpie lines to denote the
   different markable areas on your slate. In the best penmanship you can
   muster, label them with the sharpie.

It is a pretty simple hack, but quite effective for giving your editor a bit
of A/V sync assistance.
