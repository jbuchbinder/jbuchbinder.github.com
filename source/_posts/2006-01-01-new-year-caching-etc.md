Happy New Year, as well as happy [whatever solstice holiday you choose to celebrate][1]! Once again, I’m [slacking][2] in the [“blogging”][3] department. I recently made a few changes to the server, the most important of which will speed this up by fixing the [memory map cache][4] used to render pages, thereby removing the molasses from the page loading process. There are also a few new tracks under **Artists and Projects** on the site, so please feel free to take a listen. More development news coming soon, as I’m planning on a new [FreeMED][5] release (0.8.2), as soon as we’re done with [QA testing][6].
