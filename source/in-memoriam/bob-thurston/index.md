> *Robert Lee Thurston, 74, of Central Lake, died Tuesday, July 17, at Munson Medical Center after a short illness.  He was born November 21, 1937 in Ann Arbor, the son of Lee Mohrmann and Jessie Holmes (Gothro) Thurston. Bob attended public school in Lansing, where his father served as Michigan’s Superintendent of Public Instruction. Bob earned a Bachelor’s degree from the University of Michigan, and taught history at Interlochen from 1963 to 1967. This May, Bob attended Interlochen Arts Academy’s 50th anniversary celebration. After earning a Master of Arts from the University of Connecticut, Bob worked as a musician, playing violin with several professional bands in Connecticut.  Bob is the fourth generation in his family to live in Central Lake. Throughout his childhood, Bob’s family returned each summer to the family cottage at Birch Point on Intermediate Lake. As a boy, Bob was a camper at YMCA Camp Hayo-Went-Ha on Torch Lake, and returned to work summers there beginning in the 1970’s. In 2006, Bob and his wife, Judith, moved to Central Lake with their two youngest  grandchildren. Since then, Bob has been active in local music groups, continued to work summers at Hayo-Went-Ha, and was an occasional contributor to The Antrim Review.  Bob is survived by his wife, Judith, by his stepsons, John (Jennie) Heald of Connecticut and William and Geoffrey Heald of Virginia, by his grandchildren, Jessica (Kevin) Hornung, Elizabeth (Ben) Gilmore, Abigail (Ben) Miller, John (Diana) Heald, and Naomi (Noel) Crespo of Connecticut, and Amber and Alexander Heald of Central Lake, by three great-grandchildren: Justin, Samantha, and Andrew Hornung, and by three men Bob thought of as sons: Patrick Conner of Maine, Adam Meikle of Connecticut, and Robert Wilkinson of Whitley Bay, England.  Bob was preceded in death by his parents, and his sister, Jane Katherine Thurston.  Arrangements have been handled by Reynolds-Jonkhoff Funeral Home in Traverse City. Bob gave his body to The University of Michigan Medical School for research and education. No memorial service is planned.  Memorial contributions may be directed to YMCA Camp Hayo-Went-Ha  (919 N. East Torch Lake Drive, Central Lake MI 49622) where Bob worked and volunteered for the last 23 summers. Please add your message to the “Bob Thurston memorial” on Facebook.*
