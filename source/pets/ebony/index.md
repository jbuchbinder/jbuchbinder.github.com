Hi, my name is **Ebony**, and I’m a rottweiler/shepherd mix.


I was born in 1991, and I’m an only “child”, since all of my brothers and sisters were killed by my mom’s owner.

My nicknames include “Snoo”, “Eb”, “Ebanu”, “Joe Isuzu”, “Eba-snoo”, “Snoo-zoo” and a lot more like those.

In May of 2007 I was diagnosed with meta-static tumors, with the vet giving me very little time left. Jeff decided not to have me put down, and I have been relaxing and enjoying the last days of my life.

*Update: Ebony died on June 20th, 2007 at 08:00 PM EDT. Thanks to all of his friends who have sent their condolences.*
