  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote>
  <p><strong>Narrative exposition</strong>, or simply <strong>exposition</strong>, is the insertion of important background information within a story; for example, information about the setting, characters’ back-stories, prior plot events, historical context, etc. (from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposition_%28narrative%29">Wikipedia</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Within the confines of the skeleton of a film work (the script), there are many ways to impart information which would not otherwise be assumed by the viewer or implied by the filmmaker. I posit that the way in which expository information is imparted to a viewer via the medium of film is as important <em>if not more important</em> than the information which is being imparted.</p>

<p>As with any other aspect of film as an art form and medium, there isn’t a single “correct” way of doing anything. There isn’t one particular correct framing which needs to be used for a shot, not only a single focal length lens or camera brand which would have to be used to get the only valid shot possible – and in much the same vein, there are many different more-or-less-equally-correct methods of imparting that information. I’d like to explore the mechanisms and caveats of each of them.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A friend’s son asked me which Superbowl team I would be rooting for during the big game – and I didn’t have a satisfactory answer for him. Team sports have always held a “<a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/10/16/five-case-studies-on-politicization/">red tribe/blue tribe</a>” quality to me, even from a fairly early age. A great deal of that has to do with how we become associated with team sports, among other concepts.</p>

<p>There is a certain <a href="http://www.apa.org/monitor/apr04/beliefs.aspx">genetic component</a> in how certain concepts, particularly belief systems, are transmitted – but studies tend to indicate that our beliefs are, at least, initially drawn from the belief systems of our parents (see: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobo_doll_experiment">1960s Bobo Doll experiment</a>). This means that our initial viewpoints tend to stem from our parents, although it should be noted that some belief systems (when pushed too strongly by parents), result in children <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0007123413000033">rebelling against those same beliefs</a>.</p>

<p>Regardless of all of that, team sports is a bit too – arbitrary – in its fandom. A great deal of knowing which team you’re going to be rooting for is tied up in where you live in proximity to that team. The upshot of this is that if you had been born a hundred miles away from where you were born, there’s a very distinct chance that your favorite sports team would be different. It’s vaguely the same lottery present with religion – if you were born to a family of a different faith than your parents, there’s an overwhelming chance that you would follow that faith instead of whichever faith (or non-theist belief system) you have now. The same can be said for political ideology ; whether primarily by genetics or primarily by learned behavior, we tend to “inherit” these things from our parents (or other primary role models).</p>

<p>Tribes are artificial constructs meant to extend natural family bonds beyond those with close genetic similitude, and the notion is generally thought to predate the modern notion of the Nation-State. The internal workings of tribalism at a sociological level are constantly being challenged by anthropologists and sociologists, but we do have a number of fairly solid theories describing their operation, at the moment.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Patriotism is, fundamentally, a conviction that a particular country is the best in the world because you were born in it - George Bernard Shaw, 1893</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Patriotism is framed as being a larger, more structured version of team fandom – at least, in my supposition. If our fealty is simply based on luck of birth, how much stock should we put into it?</p>

<p>I’m going to round this out with a very simple observation: if it makes you happy (and isn’t hurting other people), there’s probably no reason why you shouldn’t be doing it. If sports fandom is your thing, by all means, don’t let my pseudo-analysis hinder you from enjoying the trials and tribulations of your favorite team. If not, I hope that this will, at least to some degree, help explain why others are so fascinated by their favorite tribe / team / nation.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the larger search for guidance, justification, or confirmation, we tend to weigh different opinions – especially expert opinions – based on how they relate to our trust “weighting” of them, by association. That being said, there are two, drastically different, models of weighted opinions: experts, or everybody (which can be understood through the concept of “universal relativism”).</p>

<h2 id="what-constitutes-an-expert----education-vs-experience">What constitutes an expert – education vs experience?</h2>

<p>Experts, with expert opinions, are the preferred mechanism of conferred knowledge in academia. Departing from the trappings of academia for a moment, it can also be asserted that extensive experience also can produce an expert. I personally prefer the latter to the former. Anecdotally, <a href="http://redlinedoc.com/">my father</a> (who is a physician, but not a GP), used to tell me that his functional medical knowledge came primarily from his internship and residency, rather than having been conferred during medical school.</p>

<p>I have referred to the self-taught school of learning as the “<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119217/">Good Will Hunting</a> school of education”, referencing the Will Hunting character’s iconic line about education:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You wasted $150,000 on an education you coulda got (sic) for $1.50 in late charges at the library.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The role of seasoned educators in higher education should not be undervalued, nor should all skill-sets or educational concepts be learned exclusively or primarily through experience rather than through a traditional learning environment.</p>

<p>A distinction could be said to be made between hard and soft sciences (and which was pointed out by my good friend and colleague Chris), in that soft sciences are generally predicated on observations and theories which are not primarily verifiable (for the most part). Hard sciences have the benefit of verifiable and reproducible results, which allow them to be absorbed without a particular mentor. Soft sciences rely heavily on particular ideologies which, although they can be absorbed strictly through self-guided research, lend themselves to educational institution ideologues and their inherent personal biases.</p>

<h2 id="why-almost-universal-relativism">Why “almost universal relativism”?</h2>

<p>Relativism, being the point of view that there is no absolute truth or validity, is generally framed around the idea of “moral relativism” – having to do with ethics. I use the phrase “universal relativism”, possibly incorrectly, to describe a more intellectual form of relativism; the idea that we all have equally valid opinions, with equal truth and validity behind them.</p>

<p>I personally abhor this point of view, because it’s pretty easily dismissed unless a purely metaphysical vantage point is taken. Put in a more easily digestible way: <strong>Universal relativism only works if the world is only seen as a construct of our individual imaginations and views.</strong> If something cannot be perceived, does that mean that it does not exist? Possibly, according to that particular mode of thinking.</p>

<p>As far as disproving the idea that all theories and vantage points have equal validity behind them, take the example of the makeup of <em>The Moon</em>. If someone had the view that it was made of green cheese, it would not, in any way, affect the actual makeup of the moon, nor would it possess the same absolute validity which could be assessed through observation and analysis of the physical evidence showing the actual makeup. That’s a simple, albeit silly, example of a viewpoint which is not as equally true or valid as another.</p>

<h2 id="dunning-kruger-effect">Dunning-Kruger Effect</h2>

<p>What sort of a write-up would this be if I didn’t at least mention the Dunning-Kruger Effect?</p>

<p>We’re bad at self-assessment. It’s a cognitive bias that has the backing of some <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=search.displayRecord&amp;id=3282CD93-C8F8-1D4B-0757-5027602AE6AC&amp;resultID=11&amp;page=1&amp;dbTab=pa&amp;search=true">scientific studies</a> to show that, to varying degrees, we tend to either under or over estimate our skill levels, as well as the skill levels of those around us. This would, predictably, create issues in identifying and trusting the opinions of those who would theoretically be more skilled than we are.</p>

<h2 id="why-we-cant-have-it-both-ways-a-paradox">Why we can’t have it both ways (a paradox)</h2>

<p>Universal relativism and a system of experts are mutually impossible. They simply cannot co-exist within a person’s framework for judging expertise. This can be logically broken down like this:</p>

<p>1) Relativism believes that everyone’s opinions and observations have equal weight.
2) A system of experts believes that certain people have acquired a superior skill set or knowledge base than those around them.
3) Opinions and observations hold the same essential position as learned skills and knowledge, using the patterns established by relativism. (The Dunning-Kruger Effect would indicate that those with a certain belief in their own knowledge and skill will tend to over-estimate them against other people.)
4) A hierarchy of expertise cannot, therefore, exist in a system where everyone’s opinions and truths are considered equally valid.</p>

<h2 id="confirmation-bias-or-why-we-want-to-have-it-both-ways">Confirmation bias, or why we want to have it both ways</h2>

<p>Another, potentially more insidious, bias is <strong>confirmation bias</strong>. It’s an innate tendency we all share to favor information which confirms our own opinions, truths, et cetera – and it’s one of the reasons why relativism (or, at least, some subsets of it) are exceptionally popular. It means that we’re always right, all the time. Even if someone else is actually right, we’re still right, because our own opinions and truths would hold the same value as theirs.</p>

<p>But wait – we also like appealing to experts. There’s a logical fallacy called <strong>appeal to authority</strong>, which involves using a position of expertise or authority to disprove or dismiss someone else’s opinions and truths. For this authority to exist, we have to sanction, in some small way, a system of experts. We will however tend to ignore them when they disagree with our conclusions.</p>

<p>Or, to pervert an old idiomatic proverb, we want to have our cake and eat it too.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>There has to be some take-away from all of this ; how else are we to learn if we’re so distinctly predisposed to be terrible at accepting new points of view, or even judging the validity of those hierarchies of experts out there?</p>

<p>I tend towards the idea of a repeatable, independently verifiable methodology – although, that tends to fall apart outside of the hard sciences.</p>

<p>I suppose that, if you’re driven to universal relativism, stay there. Don’t accept hierarchies of experts, and continue to assume that everyone’s opinions are equally valid. If you believe in hierarchies of experts, make sure you take a step back and attempt to objectively examine the schools of thinking of which you are an acolyte.</p>

<p>There isn’t an absolute truth for everything, and we’re not very good at being objective – but with a little bit of work, we can try to see a little more of the other sides of problems, and perhaps bring ourselves a little needed perspective.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is my workup on effective exposure practices for cinematography. It’s an attempt to provide a fairly effective set of practices for ensuring the best consistent image.</p>

<h2 id="why">Why</h2>

<p>To keep a consistent feel between shots (and overall), there are a few factors which should generally stay the same between shots:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>ISO Sensitivity</strong>. This generally should remain at the “native ISO” level of your camera’s sensor, which is the level at which the sensor exhibits the maximum amount of dynamic range (levels of difference in luma between lightest and darkest areas representable). I’ve been pretty good about shooting most of my footage at 400 ASA, which matches light levels used with the most common traditional film, but this may vary, depending on the camera body you’re using.</li>
  <li><strong>Shutter Speed</strong>. It’s an amateur mistake to unwittingly vary the shutter speed / exposure time between shots, because the way we perceive motion in film is very particular. The majority of film work tends to use a 180 degree “shutter angle”, which corresponds to <code>1 / 2 x fps</code> – which means that with a frame rate of 24 fps, your exposure time / shutter speed would be 1/48th of a second to correspond to a 180 degree shutter angle. (There are obviously exceptions to this basic rule, but it <em>tends</em> to be consistent within a scene.)</li>
  <li><strong>Aperture</strong>. This may not have to remain constant between shots, but you don’t want your aperture settings to be dictated by the amount of light available to you, alone. It’s better to be able to compose a shot artistically, then deal with the amount of light coming into your lens separately. Not to mention that far too many “independent film” cinematographers have gotten a reputation for jacking the aperture all the way open and leaving it there.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="zones-and-the-zone-system">Zones, and the Zone System</h2>

<p>This is an interesting working understanding of light, and how to properly expose, put together by <a href="http://www.anseladams.com/ansel-adams-information/">Ansel Adams</a> and Fred Archer. I’m not going to go into the specifics of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_System">Zone System</a>, but it is important to understand the basic concepts to properly understand the rest of this article.</p>

<h2 id="light-metering">Light metering</h2>

<p>I can’t recommend a traditional light meter enough. It’s completely worth the cost, and will save hours of wasted work and blown shots – and generally will tend to be superior, in terms of accuracy, to cellphone apps.</p>

<p>(My light meter is an old manual light meter, which my father gave to me – just showing that it’s not the bells and whistles, but rather the basics which are important to have.)</p>

<h2 id="nd-filters-vari-and-otherwise">ND filters (vari and otherwise)</h2>

<p>So, if you can’t adjust the ISO sensitivity or shutter speed, and shouldn’t be adjusting via the aperture, how do we control our exposure levels?</p>

<p>Enter the <strong>neutral density filter</strong>; sunglasses for your lens. Depending on your rig (and funding levels), you could either use a “vari ND filter” (which is essentially two circular polarizing filters, mounted in a single assembly), or a series of single ND filter sheets of varying ratings (which can be combined to form particular exposure reduction values). Most indie cinematographers tend not to have 4x4 filter slots, so it may be easier, with the notable exception of lens changes, to go with vari ND filters.</p>

<p>I highly recommend the <a href="http://amzn.to/1B6v40h">Tiffen 77VND filter</a> for vari ND work, assuming a 77mm filter thread – which is common amongst a fair amount of cine lenses. (If you’re working with Cooke primes or similar glass, you’re probably not going to be be worried about any of <em>my</em> recommendations, but you’d also probably have to spring for vari ND filters with a larger filter thread size.)</p>

<p>One caveat about ND filters – they have the potential for introducing slight color casts into the picture, which makes grey cards or other white/color balancing equipment even more necessary.</p>

<p>The trick with ND filters is using them to adjust for your Zone V reading, which means understanding how to reliably adjust them to cut down a certain number of stops of light. This is an entire set of tutorials, and another topic, which is best covered elsewhere.</p>

<h2 id="lighting-for-standard-exposure">Lighting for standard exposure</h2>

<p>Medium-to-light skinned people generally are supposed to be exposed for Zone VI (+1 EV), with darker skinned people exposed for Zone V (0 EV). Zone V is pretty easy to expose for, since it essentially means setting exposure for the metering value, but Zone VI needs to be exposed at +1 EV, which means that it should be twice as bright (or a full stop brighter) than the metering value. Exposing this way may leave certain things blown out or underexposed, based on your lighting setup, but it will produce “ideal” skin lighting for a standard well-balanced exposure.</p>

<h2 id="exposing-to-the-left-right-">Exposing to the left, right …</h2>

<p>ETTR maximizes dynamic range by exposing for highlights, and ETTL maximizes dynamic range by exposing for shadows. The former prevents blown highlights, and the latter prevents details from being lost in the shadows. If you decide to use one of these techniques, it should depend on which portions of your image you’re willing to lose details in.</p>

<p>ETTR is very popular, partly due to its ability to hide one of the primary deficiencies inherent in most DSLR and inexpensive digital sensors – the way that highlights immediately clip, rather than gradually rolling off (as they do with film and more expensive sensors).</p>

<p>There are some mitigating techniques which can be used to avoid over-exposure (blowing highlights). Some of the more common ones are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Gobos</strong> - A simple “go between”, which can be used to block light. This can be made of any opaque material, and only needs to be clamped or secured between the light source and the target object or person.</li>
  <li><strong>Scrims</strong> - A screen used to soften light. This can disperse a hard light source in to a softer one, and is secured much like a gobo. As it does not decrease the amount of light appreciably, but instead spreads it out, this may not be effective for heavy over-exposure.</li>
  <li><strong>ND Film</strong> - Windows can be covered with neutral density film, effectively reducing their light-transmitting capacity. This technique has been used with great effectiveness in a number of bigger budget productions, but can be a little pricey.</li>
  <li><strong>Fill light</strong> - Matched light temperature fill light or bounced fill light can be used to raise the overall exposure level, which will bring higher zones back to a more manageable level. The disadvantage with this technique is that digital sensors tend to like a certain amount of light level variance, or they may produce a seemingly “flat” image.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="variations">Variations</h2>

<p>These techniques are designed to try to produce the widest dynamic range possible for your camera, as well as the widest possible latitude in post-processing for retaining details and image quality. There are a number of circumstances where the “standard” way of doing things could be eschewed in favor of a particular dynamic or idiom. An example would be intentionally losing the background in black to hide a lack of depth or intentionally blowing highlights around an actor to produce an ethereal quality.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Much like other parts of cinematography, there’s no one right way to do things. You don’t <em>have</em> to maintain ISO, aperture, and shutter angle / exposure time – but it can help, depending on what you’re trying to accomplish.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’ve been trying to make sense of two necessarily contrary positions in regard to skill, art, and aesthetics. This is something of which I’ve been trying to make sense for quite some time.</p>

<h2 id="aesthetics-technique-and-intent">Aesthetics, Technique, and Intent</h2>

<p>The fundamental balance of aesthetics in any art-form is, in my supposition, the balance between the personal sense and the general public sense. This is somewhat necessitated by a very strange mechanism – that of our inherent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect">inability to accurately self-assess</a> our own skills and works. I would secondarily posit that art is effectively a combination of <strong>technique</strong> (skill) and <strong>intent</strong>. (Some have additionally added <strong>context</strong> to that, but I’m going to put that aside as an adjunct of intent for now.)</p>

<p>Technique is teachable. Technique is learnable (depending on the amount of time put in, internal aptitudes, etc). Technique is something which, to one degree or another, is somewhat quantifiable. A great deal of education in the arts is devoted to attempting to teach classical techniques, if only for the sake of eventually learning which ones can be accepted and which ones can be disregarded.</p>

<p>Intent, on the other hand, is a really hairy beast. It is <strong>not</strong> able to be deterministically divined from a work in a vacuum. Even more frustrating is that it can be broken into <strong>perceived intent</strong> (how we internalize what we’ve seen, heard, and experienced), and <strong>original intent</strong> (how the artist actually originally intended the art to be consumed). But wait – the original intent can further be broken into <strong>original intent</strong> and <strong>revisionist intent</strong>, where the artist retro-fits an original intent onto a piece for one reason or another – even though it was not originally present in the design and execution phases. (My personal belief is that this is done primary for reasons dealing with popularity, but I don’t have any data to back this up.)</p>

<p>If art is a combination of these two things, how can art be “judged” by others if the original artist’s intent cannot be accurately determined? Should it be consumed and rated based on the perceived intent, which is completely subjective based on the person consuming it?</p>

<h2 id="coming-back-to-confidence-and-hubris">Coming back to Confidence and Hubris</h2>

<p>The next logical question in the context of this reading would be “what does this have to do with the difference between confidence and hubris?”</p>

<p>Confidence is somewhat necessary in the artistic process, as it helps shape the intent of the work. If we have no belief or confidence in what we are doing, it is very difficult to move forward with doing it.</p>

<p>Technique, however, requires a certain amount of humble nature to learn and master. If we believe that we have nothing else to learn, we stop learning. As the source material from Dunning-Kruger concludes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the miscalibration of the incompetent stems from an error about the self, whereas the miscalibration of the highly competent stems from an error about others</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, hubris is a base requirement for successful intent, as we need to believe that what we are doing has some sort of artistic merit, both to ourselves and for the external validation provided by others. We would need to be able to weather the concerns of others to forge our own artistic path.</p>

<p>But technique requires a humility which contradicts that hubris, for if we do not know our place in the grand spectrum of abilities, how can we ever hope to know when we can improve, or how to improve?</p>

<h2 id="societal-homogenization">Societal Homogenization</h2>

<p>To a degree, all artists who come in contact with other art or other artists will experience a level of homogenization of their work. The Millenial generation, replete with Instagram pictures, <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/doge">Doge-level memes</a>, and an inflated sense of self (unencumbered by a history of perceived failures) seem to experience this effect at a greater magnitude than seen before. I’m not sure if this is due to the replicating effect of social networking, an increased population size (similar to the compounding effect of scientific discoveries with larger populations), or some other ancillary effect with which I’m unfamiliar.</p>

<p>I mention societal homogenization of art-forms because it leads me to the next question…</p>

<h2 id="is-it-me-or-is-it-the-world">Is it me, or is it the world?</h2>

<p>The question that I ask is “Is it me, or is it the world?”</p>

<p>If my aesthetic is different than the vast popular aesthetic, am I wrong, or does society at large just have bad taste? I can’t answer that question. If aesthetics are the domain of popular opinion, I’m wrong, and confidence needs to be cut back in favor of humility and a level of homogenization. If original intent is the important part of the equation, I should be forging ahead, allowing confidence (and eventually hubris) to shape the end-products of artistic labor.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-you-do">What do you do?</h2>

<p>I’ve struggled with this – and due to the paradoxical nature of the problem, the only solution I can offer is to make the decision about how to proceed with your art based on <em>your</em> intent. If you’re trying to make a living from your art, primarily, go for the homogenization – you will see better returns from a more commercially viable product. If you’re trying to make “better art”, go your own way – either you will create something which will transcend you or you won’t, but at least you will have made art which is yours.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In “<a href="/2013/06/28/skill-in-the-age-of-instagram/">Skill in the Age of Instagram</a>”, I had opined about the lost value of skill sets, and how the modern approach to skills is to “approximate” them with shortcuts like Instagram, Autotune, and Photoshop.</p>

<p>Even though these tools offer the quickest and shortest “path” to the immediate goal, being your current project, they retard your potential growth by limiting your skills and knowledge about what you’re doing. If the pseudo-magic time-saving software is taken away (or encounters a limitation), how will you continue to be able to function without it?</p>

<h2 id="in-cinematography">In cinematography</h2>

<p>Cinematography is rife with this kind of intellectual laziness, as all creative fields have a tendency to be. A few of the places I’ve seen this have been:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Cameras</strong>. If you haven’t met a single cinematographer who has lamented that s/he is being held back by his/her rig, you haven’t gotten out very much. I call crap on that argument, mainly because of fine work like <a href="http://erbpfilm.com/film/upstreamcolor">Shane Carruth’s “Upstream Color”</a>. Learn to use what you’ve got, rather than pining for something better / different.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Color correction and grading</strong>. Virtually every amateur forum on color correction and grading is full of people asking where they can get a “one size fits all” <a href="http://nofilmschool.com/2011/05/what-is-a-look-up-table-lut-anyway">LUT</a> which will make their footage look “like Hollywood”. If there was such a thing, the entire industry of color grading specialists would just be wasting their time and skills. There’s even an “Instagram” of sorts for color grading – Magic Bullet Looks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Focus</strong>. I’m still surprised at the number of people who complain that cameras do not do the focusing work <em>for</em> them. (It’s easier to remind them that, much like other electronics, more expensive things have fewer bells and whistles – and autofocus is a terrible, terrible idea.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Lighting</strong>. As soon as low light cameras capable of cine work, like the A7s, came out, people came crawling out of the woodwork, happy that they no longer would have to worry about learning to light a scene. Putting aside the relative noisiness of the sensors, low light / no light <em>still</em> does not look like actual lit footage.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Falling into these thought pattern “traps” may seem easier at first, but following this “shortcut mentality” doesn’t may off in the long game.</p>

<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

<p>I’m not sure. I have previously said that I believed intellectual laziness or possibly a culture obsessed with instant gratification could be blamed for attempting to take the easy way out. Upon further observation, I cannot isolate a single cause behind the widespread acceptance of these tools and shortcuts, but I’ll iterate through possible causes.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Illusory superiority</strong>. We aren’t very good at figuring out how good or bad we are at something (the concept of illusory superiority contends that we usually overestimate our skill level, and the Dunning-Kruger effect also stipulates that we will eventually <em>under</em>-estimate our skill level, once we’ve gotten past a certain point). It’s one of the reasons why 90% of drivers believe that they’re in the top 10% of the skill curve – and also could help explain why using some of the aforementioned tools has become so prevalent. If we believe we’re in the top percentiles of a skill set, we’ll also believe that whatever we do (as part of our “process”) is, and must be, inherently correct. This can be seen by the inability of many Instagram filter users to understand why their tool is an “easy way out”.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Instant gratification</strong>. Our culture, especially the now-pervasive “<a href="http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2014/03/07/millennials-in-adulthood/">millenial generation</a>”, which has come into cultural power with a shorter-than-ever attention span and a lack of any understanding of their own skill levels, thanks to a society hell-bent on issuing participation awards to everyone.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Intellectual laziness</strong>. Increasingly, people seem to be less interested in <em>how</em> something works, and simply interested <em>that</em> it works.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>“Keeping up with the Joneses”</strong>. There is a look and feel “arms race”, which closely parallels the <a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/sep11/articles/loudness.htm">loudness war</a>, in that photographers and cinematographers are pressed to try to replicate the look and feel of their Instagrammified and Photoshopped brethren.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The social disease</strong>. No, not “the herp”; the disease of social networking. A seemingly endless desire for likes, “+1”s, shares, and every other type of social networking accolades, has been a driving force in recent years; “<a href="http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/cpb.2009.0003">self-status seeking</a>” is one of the primary goals of those who engage in social networking. In efforts to garner the esteem of “friends” and “contacts” on these social networks, users are adopting the lowest common denominator, in many cases, to attempt to appeal to the greatest number of followers. </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="whats-the-solution">What’s the solution?</h2>

<p>This is where I’m at a bit of a loss. I’d like to believe that, given time, those who possess the requisite skills of the trade will advance, simply by virtue of having learned to ply their skills more effectively, and those who use “skill approximation” software will drop off, or will continue to produce mediocre or cookie-cutter output.</p>

<p>That being said, it didn’t happen that way with pitch-correction software. Musical artists no longer have to be able to sing in tune (although, you could point at musicians like Bob Dylan to say “they never had to be able to”, but I digress) to be able to rise to the top of the pop music charts, and photographers don’t have to be able to take a clean picture to be able to produce a cover image for a magazine. The exact opposite, in fact, is expected from professional photographers – knowledge of manipulation tools is <em>expected</em>, and some photographers are becoming well known through their Instagram-filtered images.</p>

<p><em>(As an aside, even though I do have an <a href="http://instagram.com/jbuchbinderphotos">Instagram account</a>, I do tag my photos with <strong>#nofilter</strong> and <strong>#noprocessing</strong> to indicate that I do not manipulate them, apart from the forced square ratio imposed by Instagram.)</em></p>

<p>I can only recommend the long road – and I’m going to end this post with a quote that, while it may seem to be a bit cliché, is perfectly apropos:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Two roads diverged in a wood, and I— /
I took the one less traveled by, /
And that has made all the difference.
- “The Road Not Taken”, Robert Frost</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is even more appropriate that the oft-misconstrued sentiment of Frost’s poem was to lament that he had chosen the more difficult route, not to celebrate that he had taken it.</p>

<p>So please, take the long road of learning and discovery, rather than looking for shortcuts ; you’ll be a better, more skilled person for having done so. Good luck!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Failing is a terrible thing, we are taught. As a result of inherent cognitive biases and our own illusory superiority (look up the <a href="http://www.spring.org.uk/2012/06/the-dunning-kruger-effect-why-the-incompetent-dont-know-theyre-incompetent.php">Dunning-Kruger effect</a>, if you’re curious about this), we believe that we are right the majority of times, that we are more skilled than those around us, and that we have nothing of import to learn from not succeeding.</p>

<p>I’m going to uncharacteristically detour into a quick anecdote. I was attending a film festival a little while ago, and had ended up talking to one of the festival’s organizers. She had asked me about how I got into film, and talked a little bit about some of her own projects. After a while, I mentioned how I learned more from my failures than I did from my successes. She stopped the line of conversion, and said that she didn’t, because she “always” succeeded.</p>

<p>There’s a lesson to be learned from her. If you never fail (or never allow yourself to be put in a situation when you fail, or never accept that you have failed), you aren’t going to be able to examine your process to figure out how you can improve. If we’re at the height of our skill set at the present moment, I view that assessment as a dismal failure; we should always expect that, given time and effort, we should continue to improve as time goes on.</p>

<p>I don’t necessarily <em>hate</em> everything I’ve done in past projects, but can instead view my previous work as evolutionary improvement. Every project I do should be the best work I’ve done <em>so far</em>, and if it isn’t, I should be taking steps to make sure that the next one is.</p>

<h2 id="understanding-failure-and-criticism">Understanding Failure and Criticism</h2>

<p>We do not accept criticism well – especially not as artists. Most of our work is, to some degree, very personal. We then view attacks on our work as attacks on some part of ourselves, and become much more defensive than we should be.</p>

<p><strong>Cognitive bias</strong> is a serious issue with us accepting criticism, or any differing points of view from our own. Without getting into too much detail about the mechanics of cognitive bias, it is important to emphasize the importance of recognizing that we all possess it, to one degree or another.</p>

<p><strong>High expectations</strong> tends to result in a feeling of having failed at a much deeper level than the project at hand. A very insightful person had written (about film festival contests, in particular) that you had to be committed to making the best thing you could, not winning. It may not sound like a lot of inherent difference, but stripping your expectations for a project can allow you to be much more free in your ability to execute that project.</p>

<p><strong>People who criticize or critique can help you.</strong> Every failure which is left without analysis is a missed opportunity. You cannot learn from your missteps and mistakes without looking at them with a critical eye. A third party with less vested interest in you and your project can give you the perspective you need to improve.</p>

<h2 id="post-mortem-analyses">Post Mortem Analyses</h2>

<p>I come from a pretty heavy information technology background, and one of the favorite “failure analysis” tools we tend to use after something breaks is something called a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmortem_documentation">post mortem</a>, which is short for “post mortem documentation”. It involves a rigorous process of analyzing key elements which were responsible for both successful and unsuccessful aspects of a project or event.</p>

<p>For example, I performed both a post mortem on our <a href="/2014/05/07/48-hours-with-the-blackmagic-production-camera-4k/">2014 48 Hour Boston Festival project</a>, which documented some of the things I learned about working with a new camera body, as well as working under tight time constraints, and a post mortem on our <a href="/2014/11/07/winning-a-48-hour-film-project/">2014 48 Hour Providence Horror Festival project</a>, which took home a number of awards, including “Best Film”. Even the analysis of our <strong>successful</strong> project found issues which needed to be addressed before our next project.</p>

<h2 id="your-worst-critic">Your Worst Critic</h2>

<p>… is you (or at least, it should be). You need to be the harshest critic you have.</p>

<p>The rationale I give for this is that you cannot rely on those intrinsically involved in either your professional or personal life, who all have some sort of stake in how well you do something, to be critical enough of what you do. If you can’t expect complete, harsh honesty from those around you – then <em>you</em> are going to have to try to be as harsh as possible with what you’re putting out.</p>

<p><em>(Yes, I’m aware that the younger generation has been indoctrinated, to a certain point, with the notion that everything they do is the best, most awesome, most <strong>EPIC</strong> thing that any human being has ever done – but if you want to succeed artistically, you’ve got to overcome that.)</em></p>

<h2 id="avoid-negativity">Avoid Negativity</h2>

<p>Failure doesn’t have to be a negative thing. Any experience from which we learn a valuable lesson or draw potential improvement from should not be a negative experience. Much like the rest of life, this isn’t the end product of what you’re capable of. It isn’t the last, greatest thing you do – unless, of course, you become disheartened and stop producing things.</p>

<p>Stay positive, learn from your successes <strong>and</strong> your failures – and good luck!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My team, <a href="http://www.shootthemoonfilms.com/">Shoot the Moon Films</a>, won the
2014 Providence Horror Film Project’s “Best Picture” award, as well as scoring
a “Best Actor” award for <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3895408/">Nicholas Magrey</a>, a “Best Writing” award for
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5720821/">Natasha Darius</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3895408/">Nicholas Magrey</a>, and a “Best Sound Design” award for
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6854894/">Aaron Theodore Berton</a> for our short film
“<a href="http://www.facebook.com/TheCarving">The Carving</a>” (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4131910/">IMDb</a>).</p>

<div class="embed-video-container"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/l4OQm1J0F0w "></iframe></div>

<p>I’m used to doing post-mortem analyses on failures, so this is a fairly
unusual task ; why did “The Carving” win against other films – especially
against some very strong contenders?</p>

<h2 id="its-all-about-the-story">It’s all about the story.</h2>

<p>As usual, we didn’t base our story off of any pre-existing concepts, scripts,
etc. Although it is expressly forbidden in the rules of the 48 hour film
projects, it is common knowledge that many teams engage in this practice,
presumably because of the difficulty of producing a good screenplay in the
alloted time.</p>

<p>I’m always proud of our writers, and this was no exception. When you’re
writing a story which has to come out as a four to seven minute short, you
can’t write an over-complicated concept, or take a half hour concept and
cut it down to a few minutes of film. We had used a fairly complicated
concept for our last 48 hour effort, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3713362/">Desire</a>,
and it did not fare very well.</p>

<p>It helps to have writers who know basic tenets of writing, and there are
a ton of online courses, books, and general help to improve scripts. Without
the screenwriters, we would not have won.</p>

<h2 id="sound-is-important-too">Sound is important, too.</h2>

<p>We spend an inordinate amount of post production time on ADR-ing, Foley-ing,
and otherwise enjoying the hard work of our sound engineer, which resulted
in the best <strong>sounding</strong> audio track of any of the films in the festival.
(Don’t take my word for it – it won an award specifically for that.)</p>

<p>Your boom operator has to be paying attention, and your audio setup has to
be… something. Don’t rely on a single source of audio, either. We had an
issue with a cable which resulted in having to use on-camera audio for a
closeup shot. This wouldn’t have been possible without a backup.</p>

<p>(It’s worth noting that in editing, I ended up doing as much audio replacement
as I could before handing off to our sound engineer, to cut down on the
amount of time which he’d have to burn finding the nicest audio for a certain
take.)</p>

<h2 id="take-footage-of-only-what-you-need-to-survive">Take (footage of) only what you need to survive.</h2>

<p>Overly fancy cinematography, while fun to execute (and great for winning
Cinematography awards), is nothing if it doesn’t help propel your story
forward. If you’re trying desperately to find a way to put a quadcopter
shot into your film, you may have lost already.</p>

<p>I’m a huge fan of indulgent, long, complicated shots – but they have to
fit your idiom. If you’re making a four to seven minute long short, you
probably shouldn’t do things just for the sake of doing them. A quick
example was that I had originally planned a jib/crane shot for a particular
piece of exposition, but ended up going with a snorricam rigged shot
instead. The snorricam doesn’t add as much “value” to the end product, but
it told the story <em>better</em>.</p>

<h2 id="on-the-other-hand-think-about-your-video-quality-a-bit">On the other hand, think about your video quality a bit.</h2>

<p>If you’re shooting on a handicam, why? Entry level DSLRs are cheap and
easy to come by, and with the right set of eyes behind the camera, they
can produce great footage.</p>

<p>If you’re not color correcting or grading your footage, why? The walls
behind your characters shouldn’t be changing between shots unless you
intend for them to be doing so. White balancing doesn’t cost any money.</p>

<p>If you’re not lighting your footage, why? A guy with a decent eye and
a few clamp lights can add immeasurable depth and character to your
shots. I know that “low light cinematography” is making the rounds as
the new fad, but you’re not going to get the same type of picture. It
doesn’t cost much (or anything if you already have the equipment at
home), so what’s the harm?</p>

<h2 id="if-you-cant-do-something-find-someone-who-can">If you can’t do something, find someone who can.</h2>

<p>Unless you’re a one person shop, consider finding other people to handle
tasks – especially if they’re better at something than you are. Get
someone with a good eye to handle the cinematography, someone who can
write well to pen your piece, and people who are good with audio to handle
your post production.</p>

<h2 id="dont-try-to-win-try-to-put-out-the-best-film-you-can">Don’t try to win, try to put out the best film you can.</h2>

<p>This is advice I had received right before the 48 started, and it’s some
of the best I’ve had. Because we specifically tried to make the best film
we could make in 48 hours (within the constraints outlined by the 48), we
have a film for our own promotion and uses after the festival ended.</p>

<p>Good luck to you in all of your cinematographic adventures!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Almost six months after the Boston 48 Hour Film Festival, my team
(<a href="http://www.shootthemoonfilms.com/">Shoot the Moon Films</a>) is entering the
2014 <a href="http://www.48hourfilm.com/providence/horror/2014/">Providence 48 Hour Horror Festival</a>. Along
with seventeen other teams, we’re going to try to make a 4-7 minute
horror film in 48 hours.</p>

<p>This is pretty far out of my wheelhouse, as I haven’t made a practice of
making horror films, but my team and I are excited, and I’m going to keep
track of both our successes and our missteps here.</p>

<h2 id="day-one-preproduction-kickoff-and-writing">Day One: Preproduction, Kickoff, and Writing</h2>

<p>The one crazy moment I ended up having before everything got started was
the realization that I didn’t have enough space on the primary editing
workstation drive – and I ended up ameliorating that by purchasing another
drive down the road. Crisis averted, no hair lost.</p>

<p>I don’t like the roads around Providence, which proved to be a pain both
heading out to the kickoff event (horrific traffic and rubbernecking) as well
as on the way back (incorrect signage sending me to take a nasty U-turn in
Providence). As our producer couldn’t make the trip to the kickoff event,
I ended up taking his place.</p>

<p>After a two or three story jaunt up a staircase in a pretty non-descript
mill building in Pawtucket, I joined a group of mostly younger filmmakers,
eager to pick a category and get moving. As this was a “horror” themed
festival, we had a list of genres – and the writers had asked that I not
request one of the contingency genres, as they were more difficult to pull
off.</p>

<p>The guy standing behind me, after telling me how much he hated “Found Footage”
as a genre (which, by the way, I also loathe), ended up pulling that genre.
We ended up getting “Satanic/Demonic Possession”, and I messaged the
information back to the writers, so that they could get started on the
planning and writing process before I got back.</p>

<p>Both of the writers were coming from previous engagements, including one
who was starring in a theater production of “Frankenstein”, the other who
had costumed and was doing hair and prep work – but they still
managed to crank out the final version of a script before midnight. Everyone,
cast and crew, got sent copies.</p>

<p>From midnight until about 2:00 - 2:30 a.m., I wrote out a tentative shot list
and printed a huge piles of copies of the script. I got to sleep a little
before 3:00 a.m.</p>

<h2 id="day-two-production--shooting">Day Two: Production / Shooting</h2>

<p>At around 6:00 a.m., my wife and I got up, packed all of the equipment into
the car, and met the rest of the cast and crew at our shooting location at
7:00 a.m. We ended up having to scramble around to get all of the set
dressing components for the set, and got production underway around 10:30 -
11:00 a.m. Shooting with the BMPC4K camera made shooting, in most instances,
much faster since we could shoot in 4K and simply “punch in” for close up
shots without losing resolution. It was a neat trick which had been suggested
to me about two years ago by the director of “Chez Upshaw”, which a project
of mine had screened with at BIFF.</p>

<p>I got a chance to trot out a snorricam rig which hadn’t been used in almost
two years. It couldn’t handle the weight of the production camera, so we
were using a Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera with a modified Computar 12.5mm
f/1.3 lens stopped down to about f/4 to replace the GoPro Hero 2 we used to
use. The footage is nicely inter-cuttable with the Production Camera footage,
so I wouldn’t have to pull any rabbits out of hats in color grading.</p>

<p>We had a hard deadline for wrapping up principal photography of 5:30 p.m.,
since a number of actors and crew members had to make it back to the theater
for another performance of “Frankenstein” – including two of our actors,
our production designer <em>and</em> our makeup artist. We barely finished our last
take of our last outside shot as it started to rain heavily outside. No
equipment damaged, no shot missed.</p>

<p>We had to return props, and since my wife had taken the car, our producer
loaded up half of the equipment and my friend Chris helped me with the rest
of it, as well as helping me return some of our borrowed props. Another cup
of coffee later, and we were transferring about 280+ GB of footage off of the
two cameras and the boom rig.</p>

<p>One of the actors and the producer took turns sitting with me while I made
the bulk of the edits. We finished the rough cut at a little past 11:50 p.m.
The cast and crew members present watched the rough cut to confirm that there 
weren’t any glaring issues with the cut, then my wife and I went through all
of the audio to catalogue shot numbers and takes for easy sound replacement
referencing. I rendered out a reference copy for the musician doing the
scoring, uploaded it, and went to sleep before I passed out on my keyboard.</p>

<h2 id="day-three-post-production-and-making-the-deadline">Day Three: Post-production and Making the Deadline</h2>

<p>After a brief hour and a half or so of sleep, I ended up having to get up
to help my geriatric dog, who has periodic breathing issues. I got another
hour or so of sleep before my wife tossed me out of bed, and I stumbled down
the street to grab a cup of delicious Peruvian coffee to wake up. I’m pretty
sure my eyes weren’t open until half way back to the house.</p>

<p>From 6:30 a.m. until 10:30 a.m., I did the bulk of the sound replacement and
matching work as well as the coloring in Resolve. I dumped out an export for
Audition to take with me for ADR, and headed off to get the few lines that
we needed done.</p>

<p>Five actors met me over at our original shoot location, primarily so that my
dogs wouldn’t scuttle any of the takes. We wrapped sound collection around
1:30 p.m., and headed back to recomposite everything. I sent out the audio
to our audio engineer in Massachussetts, who recomposited everything together
and cleaned up some of our slightly dirtier boom audio, as well as leveling
out the speech. Final render time out of Premiere came right after that.</p>

<p>A last minute call to the hotline for the festival confirmed that we could
present HD 24 fps footage, rather than being limited to 30 fps footage (as
the website had indicated). A quick burn of a DVD and dropping footage on
a flash drive which felt <em>far</em> too large for the content we were putting on
it, and we were off to the races – so to speak.</p>

<p>We hauled the 45+ minute drive through Providence to the drop off point, and
were the first team in our group (the “B” group) to hand in our materials
40 minutes before the 7:30 p.m. drop-off deadline. Yahtzee!</p>

<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Have an on-site audio engineer to take care of ADR duties.</strong> It’s a
serious pain to have to color <em>and</em> handle re-recording.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Get the cleanest boom audio possible.</strong> Make sure your boom operator is
getting pristine audio, as close as possible to the source, and monitoring
the levels.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Make sure your audio is being catalogued on set.</strong> It was a serious time
waster to do this late at night, and put off coloring work until the next
day.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Make sure someone is arranging rides.</strong> If someone needs to shuttle crew
around, make sure it’s not one of your department heads.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Screen your graded footage a few times before finalizing.</strong> I’m really
guilty of this one, as I noticed a few places where I needed to brighten
the midtones a bit, or match the color of the grass in some exterior shots
a bit better.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Make sure to let everyone know how important they are.</strong> In a 48 hour
film festival, there are no “unimportant” people. Everyone is doing their
job, and without them, things wouldn’t come together properly. Our 1st AD
(who is, by trade, a stage manager) had never worked on a film set before
– but you’d never know it, since she brought her “A” game with her.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="special-thanks">Special Thanks</h2>

<p>I’d like to thank:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5720821/">Natasha Darius</a></strong> – My
wife, co-writer, and general driving force behind everything I do. We
wouldn’t have done the 48 if it wasn’t for her talented writing and
creative spark, her tenacity in keeping everyone moving in the right
direction, and her infectious optimism. She was costuming and doing
actor prep for “Frankenstein” during this weekend, which made
everything else she was able to do (including prop shopping,
organization, writing, et cetera) that much more impressive.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3895408/">Nick Magrey</a></strong> –
Although he overbooks <em>everything</em> and wears far too
many hats, nothing would get done without him. Co-writing, acting,
production designing, wardrobe supervising… the list goes on and
on. Not to mention that he did this during the closing weekend of
his leading role in “Frankenstein” at the Bradley Playhouse.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4840208/">Curtis Reid</a></strong> – I give
him a lot of crap about everything, but he’s the other half of the
organizational aspect of all of this, as well as running <strong>Shoot the
Moon Films</strong>. I like to tell people “you need to get a Curtis” when
they ask how I manage to get stuff done. I shouldn’t downplay his
acting, either – I just usually focus on all of his producing duties.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6562104/">Jon Demers</a></strong> – He kept me
awake, gopher’d the crap out of everything, drove me everywhere, 
<strong>and</strong> found time to act. Give that man a gold star.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6854892/">Hannah Viens</a></strong> – 1st AD 
extraordinaire. She made sure that we were getting everything done,
and that’s no small task.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6562109/">Chelle Wright</a></strong> – Even
though she’s been doing MUA duties with us for a while, this was her
acting debut. Thank you for not only putting in a great performance,
but also for making everyone look so good!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The Entire Verrill Clan</strong> – 
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5220888/">Elizabeth</a> was acting and doing
sound work, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6854893/">Patricia</a> was taking
still photos, and they were nice enough to lend their lovely home and
property to us to trash judiciously for filming.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4941340/">Maureen Vlaco</a></strong> – You have
one of the longest commutes to set, but you were cheery, helpful, and
even drove <em>back</em> for audio re-recording right before a funeral. You
brought that character to life – thank you!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6854891/">Keith Murphy</a></strong> – I’ve never
worked with a stunt/fight guy before, but he was fantastic, in addition
to lending a double-popped-collar performance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6562110/">Paul Magrey</a></strong> – Booming, as
well as helping with all sorts of other stuff on set. Awesome job!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6562108/">Brandi Demers</a></strong> – You’re my
right hand on set, and threw in a performance to boot, not to mention
the time you put in prepping props!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Our post-production crew</strong> – 
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6854894/">Aaron</a> and
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6476893/">Garett</a>, especially. You guys
added so much production value with the precious little time we gave
you to work, and your work <em>completely</em> speaks for itself.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="screening">Screening</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4131910/">The Carving</a> is premiering on
<a href="http://horrorpvd-b.eventbrite.com/">October 29th in Providence at 9:00 p.m.</a>.</p>
