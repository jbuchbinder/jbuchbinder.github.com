I have been hard at work, getting [our favorite medical billing engine][1] to support generating patient statements, in addition to its current payer billing capabilities. In addition, I have been adding some rich font support for [PDF][2]s, while all font attributes are stripped out or ignored when generating plain text or other formats which do not support it.

In addition, I was reading an [article][3] on building an extremely low-latency box for professional audio, when I was appalled to see a comment that “the most obvious choice of operating system for musicians is still Windows XP Professional”. If I may rant a little, I really don’t think so. There’s nothing obvious about awful latencies, rarely consistent hardware support, and on-and-off blue screens. With [jack][4], [ardour][5], [hydrogen][6], [jamin][7], and other fine professional audio products, what is stopping **you** from making the move from the dark side?
