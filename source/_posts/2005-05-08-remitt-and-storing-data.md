I’m back to work on [REMITT][1], the REMITT Electronic Medical Information Translation and Transmission engine. (Yes, I know it’s a [recursive acronym][2].) There’s a significant portion of development which is going into attempting to be more [elegant][3] in my code. We’re attempting to add trending and other important features to REMITT, as well as some that are probably best kept quiet until they are ready.

Work on FreeMED’s [wxWidgets][4] remote UI is coming along well; we’re working on patient entry right now. I’d throw up a screenshot or two, but maybe after the weekends’ coding time has come and gone …
