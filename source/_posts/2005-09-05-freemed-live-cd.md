I’m currently finishing up the final touches on the [FreeMED][1] 0.8.0 release right now, as [REMITT][2] 0.3 and [phpwebtools][3] 0.4.5 are already “ready to ship”. I’m also touching up a nice FreeMED Live CD, based on the [kubuntu][4] “Hoary Hedgehog” live CD, so everyone will be able to try out FreeMED REMITT without having to make the commitment of formatting a machine. Thanks to [B-MAS, Inc][5] for funding (and helping out with) the development of this live CD. As soon as the rest of the bugs are ironed out, it will be released on [FreeMED’s sourceforge page][6]. I look forward to hearing from everyone about this on the new FreeMED support list (support at freemedsoftware.org)!
