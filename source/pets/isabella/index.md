[![Loneliest Mup ... ever.][2]][2] My name is **Isabella**, and I’m a gremlin. (no one knows my real breed) My old owner boarded me up in a foreclosed house and left me to die, but Jeff and Tasha took me in. I’m kinda partial to them…

I love playing with chew toys …

… and I’m the most relaxed dog you’ll ever meet.
