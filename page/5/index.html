  <div class="entry-content"><p># </p>

<p>In 2007, I had posted a patch for the <a href="http://www.adstech.com/products/USBAV-709-EF/intro/USBAV-709_intro.asp?pid=USBAV-709-EF">ADS DVD Xpress DX2</a> device to work on Linux, but it had been based on an antiquated kernel version, etc.</p>

<p>Since then, <a href="http://go7007.imploder.org/">someone</a> was nice enough to post an updated version of the driver, but without DVD Xpress DX2 support. I put together a patch which ensures that the drivers now compile and use the new I2C and V4L2 APIs. I can’t guarantee that it works, only that it compiles the driver properly now. Theoretically it should work, but I can’t find my DVD Xpress DX2 to try out the hardware properly.</p>

<p>I do not like camera phones in the same way that I don’t particularly care for flash photography; you can produce good results (or at least passable results) with either, but the majority of stuff that comes out of it is just pure crap.</p>

<p>I recently moved to one of Sprint’s CDMA Android offerings, the HTC Hero. I just finished the <a href="http://geekfor.me/">flashing/rooting process</a>, since I don’t particularly care for devices that try to lock me out of their own functionality. (The key to doing this with the “newer” Sprint CDMA Hero phones is apparently using an older version of the recovery image and making sure you have enough available memory to run the image flash, but that’s beside the point.) This particular device came with a 5 megapixel built-in camera, and though I know that <a href="http://forum.digitalcamerareview.com/showthread.php?p=5354">resolution != quality</a>, it does seem to produce *passable* images. Not great, but passable. I’m hoping to see an improvement when the CDMA Hero sees “official” <a href="http://phandroid.com/2010/02/16/sprint-hero-moment-getting-android-2-1-early-2q10/">Android 2.1 support</a>. This OS version fragmentation is bunk, but at least I can upgrade as soon as the pieces are available for another model. <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/02/18/editorial-ten-reasons-why-windows-mobile-6-5-misses-the-mark/">Suck that, closed source technology</a>.</p>

<p>Am I giving up the <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&amp;fcategoryid=139&amp;modelid=17779">40D</a>? Hell emphatically *no*. But I can capture a few things I might miss fumbling for the camera bag. At least, I hope I can.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p># </p>

<p>I have just wrapped up (no pun intended) work on an initial version of a CLI <a href="http://jasperforge.org/projects/jasperreports">JasperReports</a> wrapper, based heavily off the work of <a href="http://jasperforge.org/plugins/project/project_home.php?group_id=97">jasperCall</a>. It’s also quite similar to the work being done on <a href="http://code.google.com/p/runjasperreports/">RunJasperReports</a>, although it was specifically designed to be integrated into <a href="http://freemedsoftware.org/">FreeMED’s</a> reporting engine, as it is put together as a fatjar. It currently supports PDF, XML, XLS and HTML output, and should theoretically support parameter passing, though I haven’t tried it out yet. It has a newer version of <a href="http://www.mysql.com/products/connector/">MySQL Connector/J</a> baked in as well, so it shouldn’t require any external libraries outside a standard JRE install to function properly.</p>

<p>The code can be check out of anonymous Subversion from  if anyone is interested in building it. (It obviously should require Java 6 JDK to compile properly.) Hopefully I’ll get around to tagging and releasing versions of it for download shortly, if anyone shows interest in it.</p>

<p>I’ve decided to do a little feature on films that I liked for one reason or another, and to start out, I have chosen a scifi/comedy flick from the 1980s called <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086856/">The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the Eighth Dimension</a>.</p>

<p>It’s a pretty funny send-up of scifi movies which take themselves too seriously. I think that after watching it, it’s pretty apparent that none of the actors were told that it was supposed to be a comedy. Peter Weller plays the entire movie completely straight, which makes his lines all the funnier. John Lithgow was very funny, in his strange and quirky way.</p>

<p>It was apparently very difficult for the studio that owned it to release “Buckaroo Banzai” because of some legal issues, but it finally made it to DVD in the last few years.</p>

<p>The simple recipe is to add this to root’s cron:</p>

<p><code>
* * * * * /usr/bin/gmetric -c /etc/gmond.conf -n pf_states -v $(/usr/local/sbin/pftop -b | grep pfTop | cut -d/ -f2 | cut -d, -f1) -t int32 -d 120 2&gt;&amp;#038;1 | logger -t pf_states
</code></p>

<p>and install the <strong>pftop</strong> package along with a gmetric binary and a working <strong>/etc/gmond.conf</strong> configuration file. It might be advantageous to check for the maximum number of states as well.</p>

<p>In addition, you might want to know which pf rules are passing how much traffic. A nice easy way of doing this is to create this file as <strong>./pfstates</strong> (make it executable, of course):</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/perl
# pfstates
# jeff@ourexchange.net
my $limit = shift  || 0;
 
my $seg = 0;
my @s = [];

while (chomp( my $line = )) {
        $s[$seg] = $line;               
        if ($seg == 2) {
                $seg = 0;
                if ($s[1] !~ /States: 0/) {
                        my $states = 0;
                        if ($s[1] =~ m/States: (d )/) {
                                $states = $1;
                        }
                        if ($states &gt;= $limit) {
                                print "[$states] $s[0]n";
                        }
                }
        } else {
                $seg  ;
        }
}
</code></pre>

<p>…. then you would pipe pfctl’s state output to it:</p>

<pre><code>pfctl -v -s rules | ./pfstates
</code></pre>

<p>Optionally you could add a “minimum level” of connections you want to see:</p>

<pre><code>pfctl -v -s rules | ./pfstates 100
</code></pre>

<p>for example to see only rules passing 100 or more active connections.</p>

<p>I have a hate/hate relationship with Exchange Server. I hate it, and I’m pretty sure it hates me.</p>

<p>Why someone would design a system to expose every bit of data for a system through a nice standard protocol like IMAP, then only allow certain things to be viewed through a piece of crap proprietary protocol like MAPI just boggles the mind. I’m sure it’s part of their “vendor lock-in” thing, but it just pisses me off.</p>

<p>Anyway, I found out that to completely backup an Exchange account (as I have been doing over the last week or so for different accounts), you also have to backup the non-mail portions. I ended up using a deprecated library called <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/slide/clientjavadoc/overview-summary.html">Jakarta Slide</a> for WebDAV client support, which helpfully came with a <strong>SearchMethod</strong> call which was capable of running the specialized XML query required to backup the data.</p>

<p>The XML I ended up using was:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM "URL"
</code></pre>

<p>in case anyone is interested. Again, I have a fatjar of this utility, but I have to check with work to make sure they’re okay with me releasing it before I can post it anywhere.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p># </p>

<p>I hate it. IMAP Synchronization, that is.</p>

<p>In an effort to migrate users from one *shudder* Exchange provider to another (after getting shot down for proposing first Zimbra, then standard mail server stuff, then <a href="http://www.openchange.org/">Openchange</a>), I have been going through all of the available IMAP sync software that I could find.</p>

<p><strong>mbsync</strong> () – We use this for IMAP backup, so I figured it would be a good idea to try it for syncing between two IMAP servers. *Crash*. *Segfault*. This is one of the reasons I’m not a big fan of really low-level apps written in C.</p>

<p><strong>imapsync</strong> () – Written using a Perl library, this offered the promise of fast syncing, and appeared to work in test runs. That is, until it encountered folders with spaces in them, and threw up all over the terminal. Really, it wasn’t a use-case for *anyone* to have spaces in folder names? I could have put some effort into fixing the library and/or script, but I figured that if something that basic wasn’t working for a fairly mature library, this wasn’t going to be pretty.</p>

<p><strong>The Imap Migration Tool</strong> () – Written in PHP, with a two or three step process. Was meant for moving stuff, not keeping them in sync, so running multiple times would cause additional copies of messages to be created. Also, it seems to have been written in some prehistoric form of PHP, which required hacking to get it even marginally functional. Even then, it spat tons of warnings and nasties, which made me a little nervous to use it on any important mailboxes.</p>

<p><strong>mailsync</strong> () – I don’t even remember why this one didn’t work, only that I wasted a fair amount of time playing with it to get it to try to migrate using the scheme we were working with to no avail. Scratch another one.</p>

<p>Solution … I had to roll my own. This is *stupid* to the highest degree, but I rolled something using <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/javamail/">javamail</a> into a self-contained “fat jar” using <a href="http://fjep.sourceforge.net/">fatjar</a>. It works sickeningly well, and actually respects existing messages by message id, so that if for any reason I have to break the sync process, it’ll skip past anything it has already done. I made it non-destructive because it seemed like seriously bad juju to have a sync tool purge out email…. If I get permission from work, I’ll post the jar for anyone with Java 1.6 to use.</p>

<p>As an aside, it took a little bit of hackery to get fatjar running outside eclipse. The relevant section of build.xml was:</p>

<p>I have recently had cause to proxy a J2EE CXF service through an apache 2.2 instance, and thought it would be nice to share my findings. (This was all done on a Debian system.)</p>

<p>First of all, the mod_proxy pieces have to be enabled using <strong>a2enmod proxy</strong>.</p>

<p>A fragment has to be added with the proxying bits and some limitation:</p>

<pre><code>     Order allow,deny
     Allow from all


ProxyPass /EXPOSEDURL http://SERVER:PORT/URL
ProxyPassReverse /EXPOSEDURL http://SERVER:PORT/URL
</code></pre>

<p>Reloading apache configuration should enable the proxy properly. The only other possible issue is that in addition to the WSDL URL, you’re going to have to specify a “proxy” URL, which is just the service URL without ?wsdl at the end of it. A fragment of PHP’s SoapClient would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>$url = "http://server.domain:8180/services/MySoapService?wsdl";
$sc = new SoapClient( file_get_contents($url), array(
          'login' =&gt; $my_username // optional for basic auth
        , 'password' =&gt; $my_password // optional for basic auth
        , 'compression' =&gt; SOAP_COMPRESSION_ACCEPT | SOAP_COMPRESSION_GZIP
        , 'location' =&gt; str_replace('?wsdl', '', $url) // force this to work through proxies
));
</code></pre>

<p>The magic in that last segment was the “location” parameter, as it specifies the proxy. Good luck!</p>

<p>I really like Ubuntu — I use it for all of my workstations/laptops, and have for the last several years. I do not, however, like it when people tell me that something that’s clearly and demonstrably a bug in a system <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/soyuz/ bug/494081">simply isn’t a bug</a>. Fie on your crappy PPA build system, I’m just not going to build more Ubuntu packages for things. I’ll just go back to only packaging Debian server packages.</p>

<p>Way to build community, Canonical.</p>

<p>I quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>The buildds[sic] have no internet access, so you can’t use installer packages (packages which need to download the undistributable archive from the official location) on buildds (e.g. as build dependencies).</em></p>

<p>Kill that damn “healthcare” bill. Kill it dead.</p>

<p>I’m as shocked as anyone else that I’m agreeing with morons who wear teabags on their hats and think that universal healthcare is some bizarre form of fascism, and that everyone is a Nazi. Not to fear, I’m not agreeing with them on *everything*, just on one thing: this “healthcare” bill sucks.</p>

<p>We saw a <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20091221-708724.html">100 </a> <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20091221-708472.html">bump</a> in the DJIA this morning after the Senate passed their bastardization of a health insurance industry subsidy bill. Of course, it had to do with the excise tax being delayed, supposedly. Not anything having to do with 25 million new customers being forced into an industry with little or no regulation. Nope, not that.</p>

<p>Progressives are counting on the bill to be improved on its way back from the House, claiming that it will be better than the version that the Senate watered down. Y’know, because it makes so much sense that these cretins who tear every good measure out of a bill with the mere threat of a tantrum (without having to do the “Mr Smith Goes to Washington” thing) are just going to smile and say “I know we didn’t do this before, but of *course* we’ll do it, now that the House of Representatives said it was okay!” I can’t figure out who are the bigger morons, the Senate democratic leadership or the guys in the Progressive movement eating this up like Frosted Shit Flakes.</p>

<p>All our lame duck president had to do was push single payer, really. It might have been the end of his political career, but would have, much as the civil rights movement revolutionized America, drastically changed the way we live our lives in this country. No more would medical bankruptcy be something with which many families are familiar, and no longer would people fear financial ruin from attempting to seek medical care. I can’t condone mandated private insurance with no real caps on what they can charge or what horrible things they can do to you when you don’t play by their rules.</p>

<p>What happened to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpAyan1fXCE">this guy</a>? Who traded him out for <a href="http://www.pnhp.org/news/2009/march/obama_to_single_paye.php">this dud</a>? With what? Oh yeah. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/08/13/internal-memo-confirms-bi_n_258285.html">Money. Power.</a></p>

<p>Give up the idea that you as a person can do anything. We’re peons, slaves to a country bought and paid for by large industries.</p>

<p>If you don’t believe single payer is not only superior in every imaginable way to the nightmare we have now and would also save us *billions* of dollars, please visit <a href="http://pnhp.org/facts/single-payer-resources">Physicians for a National Healthcare Plan</a>. The huge list of studies, including CBO ones, are eye-opening.</p>

<p>Is it the best possible thing? No. I’m sure there are better systems, somewhere. It’s not socialized healthcare, just socializing the payment structure for it. And that’s not a dirty word, morons. We socialize a lot of things for the common good. Haven’t heard too many fiscal conservatives griping about that <a href="http://www.salem-news.com/articles/december192009/defense_bill.php">636 *billion* dollar spending bill</a>. Oh yeah. ‘Cause it helps us kill the Al-Qaedas that aren’t in Afghanistan and continue blowing holes in the sand to fill them with bundles of freshly printed dollars. Like that ever helped anything. Would you like a <a href="http://www.criticalthinking.org.uk/tigerrepellantrock/">terrorist-repellent rock</a>?</p>

<p>But we’re going to mouse and complain that the government wants to take away our liberty and little American flags. I’d be more concerned with ceding government power to corporations. Privatization doesn’t make things better, it just tacks on a profit “tax” to a social venture. Look at <a href="http://www.wired.com/beyond_the_beyond/2009/12/california-in-ruins-i-blame-the-dominant-ideology-of-the-whole-earth-catalog/">California</a>… that shit is falling apart.</p>

<p>Not to worry. Your healthcare system will be following suit. Please try not to die on the sidewalk.</p>
