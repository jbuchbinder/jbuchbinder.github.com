This is a list of things that I’d like to have at some point or other, split up into categories. If you want to get me something, chances are that getting me something on this list will result in a greater chance of me liking it.

## Sound/Recording

*   [AKG Perception 220][1] or [AKG Perception 420][2] condenser microphone
*   [ART DPS II][3] digital compressor
*   [JoeMeek OneQ][4] compressor
*   ~~[12′ TOSLINK cable][5]~~ – Found these at Ocean State Job Lot for 3$ a piece.
*   [Carvin CTM100][25]: Someone had brought this model mic into the studio with them, and it seems to be versatile enough that I should be getting one.
*   [Amazon Studio Wishlist][26]

## Photography/Cinematography Related

*   ~~[Canon Speedlite 580EX][10] flash~~ - Purchased this in 2012. Then the 600EX came out, proving that Canon hates me.
*   [Canon EF 200mm f/2.8L II USM][11] lens
*   ~~[Canon EF 135mm f/2.8 soft focus lens][12]~~ - Grabbed this one from a grey market distributor in Korea. They have some really odd air-freight packaging there.
*   ~~[Canon EF 70-200mm f/2.8L IS USM][13]~~
*   ~~[Two lighting umbrellas, stands, bulbs][14]~~
*   [Three backdrops and stand][15]
*   [Wireless flash trigger][16]
*   [Amazon Photography/Cinematography Wishlist][24]: Externally maintained wishlist for my photography/cinematography gear. If you owe me one (or just like me a lot), I always appreciate gift purchases from there.
