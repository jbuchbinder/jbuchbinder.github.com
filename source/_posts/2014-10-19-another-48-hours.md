Almost six months after the Boston 48 Hour Film Festival, my team
([Shoot the Moon Films](http://www.shootthemoonfilms.com/)) is entering the
2014 [Providence 48 Hour Horror Festival](http://www.48hourfilm.com/providence/horror/2014/). Along
with seventeen other teams, we're going to try to make a 4-7 minute
horror film in 48 hours.

This is pretty far out of my wheelhouse, as I haven't made a practice of
making horror films, but my team and I are excited, and I'm going to keep
track of both our successes and our missteps here.

## Day One: Preproduction, Kickoff, and Writing

The one crazy moment I ended up having before everything got started was
the realization that I didn't have enough space on the primary editing
workstation drive -- and I ended up ameliorating that by purchasing another
drive down the road. Crisis averted, no hair lost.

I don't like the roads around Providence, which proved to be a pain both
heading out to the kickoff event (horrific traffic and rubbernecking) as well
as on the way back (incorrect signage sending me to take a nasty U-turn in
Providence). As our producer couldn't make the trip to the kickoff event,
I ended up taking his place.

After a two or three story jaunt up a staircase in a pretty non-descript
mill building in Pawtucket, I joined a group of mostly younger filmmakers,
eager to pick a category and get moving. As this was a "horror" themed
festival, we had a list of genres -- and the writers had asked that I not
request one of the contingency genres, as they were more difficult to pull
off.

The guy standing behind me, after telling me how much he hated "Found Footage"
as a genre (which, by the way, I also loathe), ended up pulling that genre.
We ended up getting "Satanic/Demonic Possession", and I messaged the
information back to the writers, so that they could get started on the
planning and writing process before I got back.

Both of the writers were coming from previous engagements, including one
who was starring in a theater production of "Frankenstein", the other who
had costumed and was doing hair and prep work -- but they still
managed to crank out the final version of a script before midnight. Everyone,
cast and crew, got sent copies.

From midnight until about 2:00 - 2:30 a.m., I wrote out a tentative shot list
and printed a huge piles of copies of the script. I got to sleep a little
before 3:00 a.m.

## Day Two: Production / Shooting

At around 6:00 a.m., my wife and I got up, packed all of the equipment into
the car, and met the rest of the cast and crew at our shooting location at
7:00 a.m. We ended up having to scramble around to get all of the set
dressing components for the set, and got production underway around 10:30 -
11:00 a.m. Shooting with the BMPC4K camera made shooting, in most instances,
much faster since we could shoot in 4K and simply "punch in" for close up
shots without losing resolution. It was a neat trick which had been suggested
to me about two years ago by the director of "Chez Upshaw", which a project
of mine had screened with at BIFF.

I got a chance to trot out a snorricam rig which hadn't been used in almost
two years. It couldn't handle the weight of the production camera, so we
were using a Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera with a modified Computar 12.5mm
f/1.3 lens stopped down to about f/4 to replace the GoPro Hero 2 we used to
use. The footage is nicely inter-cuttable with the Production Camera footage,
so I wouldn't have to pull any rabbits out of hats in color grading.

We had a hard deadline for wrapping up principal photography of 5:30 p.m.,
since a number of actors and crew members had to make it back to the theater
for another performance of "Frankenstein" -- including two of our actors,
our production designer *and* our makeup artist. We barely finished our last
take of our last outside shot as it started to rain heavily outside. No
equipment damaged, no shot missed.

We had to return props, and since my wife had taken the car, our producer
loaded up half of the equipment and my friend Chris helped me with the rest
of it, as well as helping me return some of our borrowed props. Another cup
of coffee later, and we were transferring about 280+ GB of footage off of the
two cameras and the boom rig.

One of the actors and the producer took turns sitting with me while I made
the bulk of the edits. We finished the rough cut at a little past 11:50 p.m.
The cast and crew members present watched the rough cut to confirm that there 
weren't any glaring issues with the cut, then my wife and I went through all
of the audio to catalogue shot numbers and takes for easy sound replacement
referencing. I rendered out a reference copy for the musician doing the
scoring, uploaded it, and went to sleep before I passed out on my keyboard.

## Day Three: Post-production and Making the Deadline

After a brief hour and a half or so of sleep, I ended up having to get up
to help my geriatric dog, who has periodic breathing issues. I got another
hour or so of sleep before my wife tossed me out of bed, and I stumbled down
the street to grab a cup of delicious Peruvian coffee to wake up. I'm pretty
sure my eyes weren't open until half way back to the house.

From 6:30 a.m. until 10:30 a.m., I did the bulk of the sound replacement and
matching work as well as the coloring in Resolve. I dumped out an export for
Audition to take with me for ADR, and headed off to get the few lines that
we needed done.

Five actors met me over at our original shoot location, primarily so that my
dogs wouldn't scuttle any of the takes. We wrapped sound collection around
1:30 p.m., and headed back to recomposite everything. I sent out the audio
to our audio engineer in Massachussetts, who recomposited everything together
and cleaned up some of our slightly dirtier boom audio, as well as leveling
out the speech. Final render time out of Premiere came right after that.

A last minute call to the hotline for the festival confirmed that we could
present HD 24 fps footage, rather than being limited to 30 fps footage (as
the website had indicated). A quick burn of a DVD and dropping footage on
a flash drive which felt *far* too large for the content we were putting on
it, and we were off to the races -- so to speak.

We hauled the 45+ minute drive through Providence to the drop off point, and
were the first team in our group (the "B" group) to hand in our materials
40 minutes before the 7:30 p.m. drop-off deadline. Yahtzee!

## Lessons Learned

 * **Have an on-site audio engineer to take care of ADR duties.** It's a
   serious pain to have to color *and* handle re-recording.

 * **Get the cleanest boom audio possible.** Make sure your boom operator is
   getting pristine audio, as close as possible to the source, and monitoring
   the levels.

 * **Make sure your audio is being catalogued on set.** It was a serious time
   waster to do this late at night, and put off coloring work until the next
   day.

 * **Make sure someone is arranging rides.** If someone needs to shuttle crew
   around, make sure it's not one of your department heads.

 * **Screen your graded footage a few times before finalizing.** I'm really
   guilty of this one, as I noticed a few places where I needed to brighten
   the midtones a bit, or match the color of the grass in some exterior shots
   a bit better.

 * **Make sure to let everyone know how important they are.** In a 48 hour
   film festival, there are no "unimportant" people. Everyone is doing their
   job, and without them, things wouldn't come together properly. Our 1st AD
   (who is, by trade, a stage manager) had never worked on a film set before
   -- but you'd never know it, since she brought her "A" game with her.

## Special Thanks

I'd like to thank:

 * **[Natasha Darius](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5720821/)** -- My
   wife, co-writer, and general driving force behind everything I do. We
   wouldn't have done the 48 if it wasn't for her talented writing and
   creative spark, her tenacity in keeping everyone moving in the right
   direction, and her infectious optimism. She was costuming and doing
   actor prep for "Frankenstein" during this weekend, which made
   everything else she was able to do (including prop shopping,
   organization, writing, et cetera) that much more impressive.

 * **[Nick Magrey](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3895408/)** --
   Although he overbooks *everything* and wears far too
   many hats, nothing would get done without him. Co-writing, acting,
   production designing, wardrobe supervising... the list goes on and
   on. Not to mention that he did this during the closing weekend of
   his leading role in "Frankenstein" at the Bradley Playhouse.

 * **[Curtis Reid](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4840208/)** -- I give
   him a lot of crap about everything, but he's the other half of the
   organizational aspect of all of this, as well as running **Shoot the
   Moon Films**. I like to tell people "you need to get a Curtis" when
   they ask how I manage to get stuff done. I shouldn't downplay his
   acting, either -- I just usually focus on all of his producing duties.

 * **[Jon Demers](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6562104/)** -- He kept me
   awake, gopher'd the crap out of everything, drove me everywhere, 
   **and** found time to act. Give that man a gold star.

 * **[Hannah Viens](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6854892/)** -- 1st AD 
   extraordinaire. She made sure that we were getting everything done,
   and that's no small task.

 * **[Chelle Wright](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6562109/)** -- Even
   though she's been doing MUA duties with us for a while, this was her
   acting debut. Thank you for not only putting in a great performance,
   but also for making everyone look so good!

 * **The Entire Verrill Clan** -- 
   [Elizabeth](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5220888/) was acting and doing
   sound work, [Patricia](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6854893/) was taking
   still photos, and they were nice enough to lend their lovely home and
   property to us to trash judiciously for filming.

 * **[Maureen Vlaco](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4941340/)** -- You have
   one of the longest commutes to set, but you were cheery, helpful, and
   even drove *back* for audio re-recording right before a funeral. You
   brought that character to life -- thank you!

 * **[Keith Murphy](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6854891/)** -- I've never
   worked with a stunt/fight guy before, but he was fantastic, in addition
   to lending a double-popped-collar performance.

 * **[Paul Magrey](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6562110/)** -- Booming, as
   well as helping with all sorts of other stuff on set. Awesome job!

 * **[Brandi Demers](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6562108/)** -- You're my
   right hand on set, and threw in a performance to boot, not to mention
   the time you put in prepping props!

 * **Our post-production crew** -- 
   [Aaron](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6854894/) and
   [Garett](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6476893/), especially. You guys
   added so much production value with the precious little time we gave
   you to work, and your work *completely* speaks for itself.
