<p>Another <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSN0134457520090302">30 billion ducats</a> down the toilet. I’m not sure exactly what banks are supposed to do anymore, but I could swear it <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/25/business/25nocera.html">used to have something to do with loaning money</a> to allow economic movement. Banks won’t lend money to anyone <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&amp;sid=a8ta_MEhUZ9E&amp;refer=us">without sparkling credit</a>, which means most people couldn’t get a loan.</p>

<p>Why the hell are we giving these weasels money? Their primary job is to lend money, and they can’t do that, instead favoring the primary job of funnelling money to CEOs and wealthy investors. I think AIG should probably have considered that it’s making a serious case for nationalization in that the company is proving a complete lack of responsibility in the fiscal responsibility department, while lecturing “irresponsible borrowers” about the same fiscal responsibility at the same time.</p>

<p>Well, we’re <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29671145/">going down in flames</a>. I hope you bastards had fun while it lasted.</p>

<p>(As a side note, I hate anything referring to “bailout” in a positive light. It’s not a positive thing. It’s slinging shit into an enormous chasm, and saying otherwise is wishful thinking of the highest degree. These people never cared about anything other than themselves, and nothing is going to change that. Talk about limits on investment banker salaries (for producing gornicht) and they’re up in arms, but everyone is hot on cutting autoworkers’ salaries… )</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1 id="section"></h1>

<p>It seems to be the fashion for people to hem and haw about how the United States is spiralling downward towards (horrors!) socialism. I’m still trying to figure out what the big deal is.</p>

<p>Capitalism is, by definition, survival of the wealthiest. In its purest, most unadulterated form, capitalism involves certain entities becoming very, very successful, while supressing others who would aspire to become as successful. It’s a very selfish philosophy in that it stresses the survival of the individual over the survival of the society, much as most Western religions stress the survival of the self (notions of individual souls) over the Eastern philosophy empasizing the sum total of everything over the notion of the individual. So, if capitalism is such a selfish thing, why do Americans as a people seem to despise socialism, when its implementation would benefit the majority of its population?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“Don’t forget that most men with nothing would rather protect the possibility of becoming rich than face the reality of being poor.” – John Dickinson</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As was pointed out to me a few months ago, the American dream wasn’t always the greedy acquisition of money up to and including disadvantaging other people to reach that goal; it was originally the right to live without fear of persecution, with the ability to persue one’s individual dreams and aspirations.</p>

<p>To clarify a bit further, I’m not advocating scrapping capitalism in favor of a socialist system. I’m merely pointing out that prostrating ourselves at the altar of pure, unbridled capitalism has a very predictable outcoming — the upward movement of money from a large pool of people with a decent amount of money to a very small group of people with far more money than they could ever spend. Rules and regulations in America have existed since the genesis of this nation to attempt to keep those with power from using that power to harm or disenfranchise those without power. “Conservatives” who would prefer to strip the Federal government of oversight power do so at an incredible harm to those who are not fortunate enough to be born into or exploit their way into money.</p>

<p>Lastly, I’d like to put to bed another notion about Capitalism and taxation which has been irritating me… Those on the top of the financial food chain seem to be very unhappy about shouldering a larger percentage of the tax burden than those on the lower end of the spectrum. There’s a very simple explaination to this, which brings everything very sharply into focus:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>In capitalist societies, those who are rich make their money off the backs of poor people.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>No one is worth 10 million dollars a year — they simply can’t produce goods and/or services to equal that number. A banker never really *produces* anything for anyone, instead taking the role of enabling production by loaning money to those who would actually produce goods and services. That is, if they are actually lending money to anyone. Something seems really wrong with banks having CEOs earning tens of millions of dollars or more. I think if they weren’t hating the idea of universal healthcare because they might be a few mansions short of keeping up with their snooty CEO friends paying for their share, they might not be such bad people. But back in reality, they’re just horrible people.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1 id="section"></h1>

<p>I just came back from an impromptu trip to Fort Lauderdale to attend the funeral service for my grandfather, Israel “Irving” Liss. He was born in a small town in Russia on December 20, 1917, and survived a pogram, emmigration to Israel, and eventually moved to Brooklyn. He was a professional soccer player, playing for the New York Americans after coming back from decorated service in the 101st Airborne paratroopers. And I did not know most of this a week ago.</p>

From the collection of Israel &quot;Irving&quot; Liss.</div></figcaption></figure>

<p>For reasons which still aren’t apparent to me now, familial estrangement kept me from knowing my grandfather as well as I would have liked. I do remember his dry humor, his penchant for anything vintage or collectable, and his kindness to me, no matter what the circumstances. I’m happy to have reconnected with my uncle and cousins… But I think I’d be foolish not to carry a lesson away from all of this: never take your family for granted, you only get one of them, and it’s surprising the things you wished you knew about them until it’s too late.</p>

<p>*Update: I put an entire set of photos online of this, and am posting more as I receive them — *</p>

<p>One of my pictures made it to the front page of the infamous “<a href="http://failblog.org/">failblog</a>“, consisting of <a href="http://failblog.org/2009/01/20/reputable-kids-program-fail/">a picture of a very disreputable looking van</a> with “Little Angels Program” spraypainted on the side. I had caught that image earlier in 2008 in Willimantic, CT while I was walking through the hill section.</p>

<p>It’s not Life or the New York Times or anything, but I’ll take what I can get. Probably should have color corrected that one before I sent it in …</p>

<p>I just posted 24 tracks (some are multiple versions of the same tracks) from the 2005 incarnation of the studio on mediafire. It’s mostly Jake, Natasha and I. A good deal of backing tracks provided by other musicians, featuring Bob Thurston on violin.</p>

<p>I’m getting to the point where I’m actually starting to track the guys who are primarily responsible for this awful financial mess, and. though there’s a lot of bad news, there’s also a lot of not so bad news.

I’m not advocating violence against people in the financial industry, but I’m surprised when it doesn’t happen.</p>

<p>I finally got around to upgrading the studio to use <a href="http://ardour.org/node/2251">ardour 2.7.1</a>, from the stock version which comes with the Intrepid Ibex release of <a href="http://ubuntustudio.org/">Ubuntu Studio</a>. It took <a href="http://ardour.org/files/manual/sn-mackie.html">minimal configuration</a> to get my <a href="http://www.behringer.com/BCF2000/index.cfm">Behringer BCF2000 control surface</a> working, and it worked amazingly well. Unlike in the past when I had to manually bind controls to their functions in ardour, pretty much everything was automated, so besides forcing udev to create a static link for it (so that I could plug whatever in whenever I wanted to without disturbing the actual location in /dev) everything just *worked* when I brought jack ardour up for the first time. I’ve been using ardour since the pre-version-number days, and I have to say that this impressed the hell out of me. Paul, you rock.</p>

<p>Apparently AIG, known mostly for its ability to <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2008/11/10/news/economy/aig_bailout_comparison/">go through large amounts of taxpayer money</a> in order to <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=94748529">cover</a> <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSMAR85972720080918">outrageous</a> <a href="http://www.financialweek.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080218/REG/794188688">bets</a>, is reporting that it <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20081210/bs_nm/us_aig_trades">owes another 10 billion dollars that it hadn’t reported before</a>, and which is not covered by the 150 billion dollars already allocated to it by the US government.</p>

<p>If that weren’t bad enough news, AIG has been <a href="http://mcauleysworld.wordpress.com/2008/11/17/billions-in-auto-bonuses-while-singin-the-bailout-blues/">taking advice from other industries</a> and is <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&amp;sid=aKIvmgvNl6zA&amp;refer=us">paying out large retention bonuses</a>, even after they were given sweet, sweet bailout green. I’m sure if their collars were blue instead of white we’d be hemming and hawing about how they couldn’t give their executive class performance bonuses when they’ve accepted government money, but <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/economy-watch/2008/11/senates_version_of_autos_bailo.html">why would there be any sort of equity or fairness</a>?</p>

<p>Sometimes I think back to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_Futures_Modernization_Act_of_2000">Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000</a> and its 11,000 unread pages as part of an omnibus budget bill on the last legislative day before Christmas in 2000, complete with Enron loophole, and then I realize that Congress is pretty much *always* <a href="http://www.pomtalk.com/pomtalk/2008/10/congress-introd.html">a day late and a few billion dollars short</a>. I’m wondering exactly how the <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/news/feature/2008/07/foreclosure-phil.html">financial lobbyists who paid senators to legalize Credit Default Swaps</a>, and basically <a href="http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/Investing/ContrarianChronicles/VoodooDebtAndTheComingRecession.aspx">caused this economic clusterfuck we’re enjoying right now</a>, are enjoying the way they really gave it to the average American. If we hadn’t let the financial sector run wild with <a href="http://www.bluesuitmom.com/money/dollarstretcher/shrinking401k.html">our retirement money</a>, maybe, just maybe, we wouldn’t be in the incredible mess we’re in right now. It’s just sad how we’re gleefully handing the financial industry money so that they <a href="http://jeffmatthewsisnotmakingthisup.blogspot.com/2008/07/banks-not-lending-blame-shorts.html">won’t give people credit the way they were designed to</a> as a part of this ridiculous bailout. I’m so glad we didn’t give Mr Jug Ears his way on <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/nation/president/2004-09-02-bush-social-security_x.htm">privatizing Social Security</a>. Exactly how fucked would we have been then? I mean, we were less than 10 million votes away from <a href="http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/2008/09/29/ss-privatization-bad-idea/">Bush Jr doing the same damn thing</a>. You’d figure people would learn, right?</p>

<p>Pure capitalism seems to drive pure greed and stifle innovation, yet it’s being spoon fed to us as the solution to all of our problems. “Don’t socialize anything”, they say, “capitalism means everyone can be rich!” More aptly, pure capitalism means a very few people can be very rich, and everyone else gets scraps. Do you feel those economics trickling down, and why does it smell like urine? We gave these jackals free reign under Bush and Company to do pretty much whatever they want, and eight years later they’re coming back crying about how they need *socialized* money, yet trumpeting capitalism by <a href="http://affordablehousinginstitute.org/blogs/us/2008/11/dont-blame-cra-part-3-what-passes-for-evidence.html">blaming it all on poor people</a>. Of course, it didn’t have anything to do with greed, or a failure of government to give a crap, it’s all the fault of poor people. Don’t you see, if they had just made money and become rich like the rest of us, this never would have happened?</p>

<p>One more thing I’m a little cheezed about… I just found out that my dental insurance just cut me off, saying that I have used up my allowed amount for the year. What … the … fuck? I’ve been paying into this stupid system for a very long time, and I somehow feel that if they promise health coverage, I should *get* health coverage. The people who invented deductables, premiums and copays should be brought out and forced to eat their own shoddy dogfood. Sick people, in whichever way they’re sick, deserve medical attention and care. It’s not an *option* whether we treat them or not, if they’re sick, they need to receive care. I pay health insurance premiums and *still* pay out the nose for anything I need to have done. Where’s that lovely myth of <a href="http://www.management-issues.com/2008/2/18/research/could-a-domino-effect-end-employer-funded-health-insurance.asp">employer-funded healthcare saving the day</a> when I need it? Why can’t we have a single payer system like other *adult* nations and stop <a href="http://www.worldproutassembly.org/archives/2007/04/lack_of_basic_h.html">killing 18,000 Americans a year</a>? I know, I know, we’re just starting to discontinue torturing people, so we’re supposed to get cut a little slack, but this is just ridiculous. Flush the entire health insurance industry down the toilet <a href="http://guerillawomentn.blogspot.com/2007/12/cigna-health-insurance-company-kills.html">before they kill again</a>. Oh yeah, those guys I was talking about … AIG? They’ve been <a href="http://www.groundreport.com/Arts_and_Culture/A-Critical-Review-of-AIGs-Workman-s-Comp-Division">fucking people</a> out of benefits for <a href="http://lansing.injuryboard.com/miscellaneous/searching-for-loopholes-how-will-your-insurance-company-deny-your-claim.aspx">quite a while</a>. Why not shovel some more money their way? They’ve been doing such a good job, like the rest of the health insurance industry, of <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122230334120773621.html">using your money to line their pockets so far</a>, being one of the <a href="http://www.justice.org/docs/TenWorstInsuranceCompanies.pdf.">10 worst insurance companies</a> ….</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“Don’t forget that most men with nothing would rather protect the possibility of becoming rich than face the reality of being poor.” – John Dickinson</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was astounded to read on Bloomberg news that, despite the <a href="http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/us-employers-cut-533000-jobsmost-in-34-years/00/31/342391/">lost of over 500 thousand jobs last month</a>, and the current <a href="http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/archives/economy_in_the_toilet/">toilet-bowl rated economy</a>, somehow the Dow Jones Industrial Average (and also S&amp;P 500 and a bunch of other indicators) were going up as of 3:00pm EST. Why, you ask? Because <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aN7zzWtvksfs">some asshole in a suit made something up out of thin air</a>. Some turd in an expensive suit said they thought they would make money because people are still buying <a href="http://www.cjakewilliams.com/rant031808.html">“In Case Shit”</a>. In fact, the entire idea behind the statistics induced fraud campaign we call the insurance industry is the same concept as the <a href="http://projects.exeter.ac.uk/RDavies/arian/scandals/derivatives.html">financial derivatives</a> called <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=8634">credit default swaps</a>. Yeah, really makes me want to trust them.</p>

<p>But really, is anyone worried that the financial future of this country is based on a bunch of guys making stuff up? Not that <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=93293353">people in government don’t do the same thing</a>, but these jokers actually make a living doing it. And even after an <a href="http://www.thenation.com/doc/20081006/greider">ungodly amount of capital</a> being infused, the banks here don’t want to make loans, which was the entire reason we gave them so much money. Well, that and probably <a href="http://willblogforfood.typepad.com/will_blog_for_food/2008/09/paulsons-bail-out-plan-is-for-the-rich.html">servicing Paulson</a>. That guy has “<a href="http://www.alternet.org/workplace/107340/$2_trillion_handed_out_by_paulson_and_bernanke,_but_who_got_it,_nobody_knows/">I’m a cheap corporate whore</a>” written all over him.</p>

<p>We’re probably <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/car-executives-open-round-two/story.aspx?guid={392D6345-1E64-4E9D-857E-97C2D39C2157}&amp;dist=msr_8">going to let the auto industry fail miserably</a>. I’ve <a href="http://jeff.ourexchange.net/2008/11/12/let-general-motors-die/">advocated that before</a>, but I’m not certain that we wouldn’t benefit from some sort of intervention. Definitely *not* bailing out assholes like Rick “<a href="http://blog.mlive.com/statewidebusinessstories/2008/03/gm_board_restores_ceo_rick_wag.html">I Deserve All My Millions</a> For <a href="http://www.bloggingstocks.com/2008/08/01/how-does-general-motors-ceo-richard-wagoner-still-have-a-job/">Losing Tons of Money for GM</a>” Wagoner, that’s for sure. Maybe socializing pension and healthcare benefits, maybe something else. Michael Moore had an <a href="http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/message/index.php?id=242">interesting take</a>, being from that region of the country.</p>

<p>Anyway, it’s not like something is going to swoop in and save America from <a href="http://punditkitchen.com/2008/09/25/political-pictures-wall-street-great-depression-color/">another recession/depression</a>. We’re apparently <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20602002&amp;sid=a37uyBrX6dvY">losing our homes</a> at an ever quickening rate, and it doesn’t look like there’s any relief in sight. You know, it would be wonderful to just declare that your mortgage was getting better and have it magically get better. Kinda sucks the rest of us live in the “real” world.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1 id="section"></h1>

<p>It finally happened. The spirit of giving and wonder which is supposed to accompany the “Holiday” season has finally given way to the actual <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/389966_nationshop29.html">seasonal sentiment of unrequited greed</a>. A worker at a Wal-Mart was trampled to death by consumers who <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/29/business/29walmart.html?bl&amp;ex=1228107600&amp;en=95e0984e8f92cc7c&amp;ei=5087">wanted to bum rush a store for toy greed</a>, and two people were shot at a Toys-R-Us.</p>

<p>Look, this isn’t my holiday. I didn’t tell everyone to gussy up a bunch of chopped down trees, hang dangerous glass bulbs on them and blow money you probably don’t have on gifts that people probably don’t need. But if you’re going to promote a “holiday season”, you might want to consider actually living up to it. Try donating that toy money to a soup kitchen or relief fund of some sort. Volunteer somewhere, try actually making a difference in someone else’s life for a chance. That’s about the closest you’ll get to that vaunted “Christmas Spirit”. Gifts are cool and all that, but you can probably do more to show that this whole thing isn’t a bunch of <a href="http://paragraphfarmer.blogspot.com/2004/12/christmas-is-for-pagans-too.html">co-opted pagan ritual hot air</a>. The Golden Rule is *not* “he who has the gold makes the rules”, after all.</p>
