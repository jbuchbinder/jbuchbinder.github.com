After much hemming, hawing, and gnashing of teeth, I'm migrating my years of sporadic blogging from [Wordpress][1] to [Octopress][2]. It seems to integrate a little bit better with both my "command line ethos" and my workflow. I'm sure (for anyone keeping track) that there are probably going to be some weird formatting issues, potentially broken pages, and other incidences of oddness in some places. Please excuse the mess, we're remodeling.

In addition to the move, I'm trying to move away from blog entries regarding political events -- not because I should be worried about potential ramifications for my professional/public life -- but rather because there's only a certain amount of pissing into the wind that a man can do before he gets tired of having a mouthful of piss. That's not to say that there won't be *any* political stuff here, but there's going to be far less.
