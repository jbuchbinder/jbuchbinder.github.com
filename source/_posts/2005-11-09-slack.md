I’m slacking in keeping up this weblog-thing, but in my defense, I have been a bit busy. [FreeMED][1] released [version 0.8.1][2] to the world, and I have been working in the [studio][3] a lot lately as well, working on both the Heirs of Centack audiobook and musical projects. Hopefully the [BCF-2000][4] that has been ordered will get here soon, to make mixing less of a pain. I’m also halfway through a platform change to use [PlanetCCRMA][5] as the new studio platform, since the latencies appear good with the 2.6 patched kernel they’re using. More updates as I have them…
