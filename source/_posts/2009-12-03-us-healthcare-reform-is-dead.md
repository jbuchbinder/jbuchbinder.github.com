Yep, that’s it. It has been dead for quite some time now. Unfortunately, it’s not always apparent \*why\* that has been the case.

**Warning:** Political and healthcare-related opinions below, linked to various reputable sources.

**Public Option, Single Payer, Medicare for All?** The most contentious part of healthcare reform has been the concept of a government run health care plan. [HR 676][1] refers to the idea of “Medicare for All”, extending our Medicare program for seniors to cover all Americans, effectively creating a single payer system in America. As expected, people who [didn’t give a crap about running up deficits to blow holes in the sand halfway across the globe][2] were outraged, \*outraged\* at the idea that we could possibly spend money on healthcare. So much, in fact, that they [paraded around like morons][3], complaining about how large and awful government has gotten. (You know, after they didn’t say jack since the \*last\* Democrat was president.) A simple google search seems to show that the only places that are worried about Medicare deficits are [right-wing thinktanks like the “Heritage Society” and Pravda-like news organizations like “Fox News”][4]. Did I forget to mention that Kaiser and BCBS were up there as well? Trusting insurance companies to control costs in healthcare is like handing over a chicken farm to a drooling fox. No mention whatsoever that [estimates of savings with single payer are in the hundreds of \*billions\* of dollars][5]. And those estimates aren’t some cherry-picked thinktank garbage. It’s from the CBO. PNHP has a [substantial list][6] of studies which all seem to conclude that we’re flushing money into private insurance companies. Not to mention that [59% of doctors favor it][7].

**Don’t let that fool you. The Insurance companies \*love\* this new bill.** For all their hemming and hawing, the health insurance complex is almost giddy with this new bill, which would allow them to effectively [dump the lowest income, highest risk people][8] onto a publically subsidized [but privately run][9] healthcare system. All the profits, none of the risk. Sounds like Goldman Sachs 101 to me. In a related vein, one of the major reasons that the banking and financial industry has come out against HR 676 was that part of it
