> *Without music life would be a mistake. – Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche*

Music is an integral part of my life. Here’s some information on things that I’m involved in musically.

 * [evoke](/music/evoke) – Hard rock trio with me on bass.
 * [JohnFest](/music/johnfest) – Recordings and media from John Mayer’s summer music get-together. Unofficial, of course, but the event doesn’t really have a website other than this.
 * [Open Mic at the Stonewall Tavern](/music/open-mic-at-the-stonewall-tavern) – Pictures and recordings of the Tuesday open mic at the Stonewall Tavern in Eagleville, CT. The Stonewall Tavern does have its own myspace page at . There is also a myspace page specifically for the Open Mic which I put up to point the the appropriate places, at [Mediafire](https://www.mediafire.com/folder/7wri472510iac/Open_Mic_at_the_Stonewall_Tavern)
 * [The Studio](/studio) – All of the studio-related stuff is over here
