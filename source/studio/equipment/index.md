My studio is an anomaly, in that it does not use "Pro Tools" or any other commercial software. In fact, 100% of the software used (down to the low-level hardware drivers) is open-source software. This allows unprecedented freedom in the creative process, as you aren’t tied down to any proprietary products with proprietary vendors. Of course, free software does not mean that the software is of lesser quality; in fact, many of the pieces of software used in this studio are far superior to their commercial counterparts (ardour is IMHO, far superior to Pro Tools).

**Prospective Equipment** 

*   Cables – More XLR cables would be nice, since we always seem to be running low. There’s already a bunch of nice 2 foot XLR cables for patches, but another snake and some quality 15-25′ XLR cables would be nice.
*   Memory – When does more RAM ever hurt?
*   Sound-proofing materials – You can never have enough of this stuff … 

Just in case anyone is keeping track of this, "Pro Tools" is a trademark which belongs to its parent company, just like all of the other trademarks and service marks being used here. These are my opinions, do with them what you will. End of legal disclaimer.
