Welcome to my digital photography page!

{% img /images/camera_75x81.png 75 81 %}

I have been taking pictures for years, but have been working with digital photography for a subset of that time.

Here are the cameras that I have used over the years:

*   Casio QV 5000SX – God-awful battery life; needed an external battery pack.
*   Olympus D-320L – Used this one only for a brief time. Worked pretty well.
*   [Ritz PureDigital Disposable Camera](http://www.maushammer.com/systems/dakotadigital/DakotaDigital.html) – It’s not the best quality, but the price was excellent, and it has been very durable, lasting through a lot of abuse.
*   Samsung Digimax 200
*   [Canon EOS Digital Rebel XT (350D)](http://consumer.usa.canon.com/ir/controller?act=ModelDetailAct&fcategoryid=139&modelid=11154) – This was my primary camera for almost two years. Someone broke the board with a heavy lens, so the body was retired.
*   [Canon EOS 40D](http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&fcategoryid=139&modelid=15653) – I got this in early 2008 as an “upgrade” to the 350D. Great camera.
*   [Canon EOS 5D mark III](http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/consumer/products/cameras/slr_cameras/eos_5d_mark_iii) – My current primary camera.

As for lenses for the Canon EOS bodies, my current collection includes (this is, by no means, a complete list):

*   **Vivitar 135mm f/2.8** It’s a Nikon-mount lens attached to a 5$ chinese adapter ring. It takes fantastic black and white shots, and is my favorite piece-of-crap 7$ lens.
*   **Soliger 135mm f/2.8 with 2x teleconverter**. I’m not really that fond of this lens. It’s a Pentax screw-mount lens, also attached to a 5$ chinese adapter ring. The teleconverter is okay, but this lens combination has mostly been phased out in favor of the Tamron. Especially since I think it’s a bit wobbly.
*   **Canon 50mm f/1.8**. Great portrait lens. Also known as the "plastic fantastic", among cheap lens afficionados.
*   **Canon 50mm f/1.4**. Nicer version of the 50mm f/1.8. Great for low-light shooting.
*   **Canon EF 28-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USM**. Came with the 40D, and is now my primary lens.
*   **[Canon EF 70-200mm f/2.8 L IS USM II](http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/consumer/products/cameras/ef_lens_lineup/ef_70_200mm_f_2_8l_is_ii_usm)**. My long lens, affectionately referred to as my "wedding lens" or "the bazooka".
*   **Rokinon 85mm f/1.4**. Upon reflection, I would rather have bought the de-clicked f/1.5 cine version of this, but it's a really great, really bright lens.
*   **Rokinon 14mm T/3.1 Cine**, **Rokinon 24mm T/1.5 Cine**, **Rokinon 35mm T/1.5mm T/1.5 Cine**. These are my set of Rokinon "Cine" lenses. I primarily use them for cinematography, but I have been known to use them for stills on occasion.
*   **Canon EF 135mm f/2.8 soft focus**. Got this lens grey market from Korea. I don't use it *all* the time, but when I need a specialty vintage shot, this is my go-to lens. Why use Photoshop when you can do everything in-camera? 
*   **Asahi Super Takumar M42 50mm f/1.4**. One of my M42 / Pentax screw-mount lenses; a present from my sister-in-law, off of eBay.
*   **Canon FD 55mm f/1.2**. An old Canon FD mount lens. Very bright, very sharp, but requires a Lens Doctor adapter to work with my EF mount.

I’m sure there are others, but I can’t think of them right now…
