One of my pictures made it to the front page of the infamous “[failblog][1]“, consisting of [a picture of a very disreputable looking van][2] with “Little Angels Program” spraypainted on the side. I had caught that image earlier in 2008 in Willimantic, CT while I was walking through the hill section.

It’s not Life or the New York Times or anything, but I’ll take what I can get. Probably should have color corrected that one before I sent it in …
