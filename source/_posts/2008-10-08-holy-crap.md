Every time I think I’ve heard the most awful thing done by religious people…

In the same day, I’ve heard two stories coming from the Catholic Church. Yes, I know, the guys who did the whole “inquisition” thing. But they’ve been keeping their noses clean since at least the 1950s, so I’ll start this off by pointing out that I don’t have any beef with the modern day Catholic Church. They don’t come knocking on my door like [other pointless suit-festooned fuckers][2] or [pray for me to go to hell][3], so we’re on pretty good terms.

But now I get to hear about a twelve time child molester priest, who, despite violating at least twelve children, is [still a damn priest][4], is finally asked by \*police\* to come in to face charges. What the hell is wrong with the Church on this one? Isn’t shielding a child molester simply fueling accusations that all priests are kiddie-fuckers? I mean, come on, you’re seriously screwing up in the P.R. department on this one. If the guy were a school teacher and was caught with his jimmy in a fifth grader, I would think that he would never work again, and more than likely would have \*awful\* things happen to him in prison. This guy has been doing this stuff for \*years\* and just gets moved around. Must be nice to be in J.C.’s posse.

The second point is the [whitewashing of Pope Pius XII][5] of any sort of culpability in the holocaust. He didn’t exactly hold open the doors of the gas chamber, but by most accounts he [did absolutely nothing][6]. Now, I’m not sure exactly how far the criteria for becoming a Saint has fallen, but I’m sure letting people die isn’t exactly one of the prerequisites for it. I mean, [Mother Teresa][7] has had a long road to it, after having spent many years tending to sick people. Pius let a total of [between 10 and 26 million people die][8] during the Nazi’s reign — and he gets to be a Saint?

I know Ratzinger was in the [Official Hitler Fan Club][9], but isn’t this a little much? His excuse for not having shot anyone as a Nazi Youth was an “infected finger.” Not that he didn’t want to, not that he objected, that he had a *bad finger*. At least [the last guy][10] actually improved things when he was pope, and in fact issued an apology for the exact thing that Ratzinger is trying to promote the sainthood for: [doing jack squat during the holocaust][11]… and maybe a little [money laundering][12]. Who let this particular joker be pope, anyways?

I think the Vatican kinda needs to get its act together. I’d rather go back to laughing and pointing at stupid sex scandals and child molestation in [much lower hanging fruit][13] than having to see a 2000 year old institution made a laughing stock by poor leadership. Well, Ratzinger, ball’s in your court. Don’t make the Jewish guy on the cross cry any more than you have to.
